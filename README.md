## 🧠 Project Overview

This capstone project demonstrates the application of data science principles, tools, and techniques to a large-scale, real-world dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) as a case study, the project explores sentiment trends, rating patterns, and genre-based preferences by combining structured metadata with user-generated content.

To reflect the breadth of the MSDS program, the project integrates **SQL** for data extraction, **R** for exploratory visualization and statistical summaries, and **Python** for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## 📌 Abstract

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is one of the most extensive public repositories of film metadata, providing detailed information on titles, ratings, genres, crew, and user feedback. This project explores the IMDb dataset to investigate patterns in sentiment, genre preference, and rating behavior. Using SQL, R, and Python, the study aims to identify features associated with high or low user ratings, explore genre-based rating distributions, and analyze trends across decades of film releases. Findings will be translated into actionable insights that can inform content curation, audience targeting, and recommendation strategies in the film industry.
