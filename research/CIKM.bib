abstract = {Hashtag trends ignite campaigns, shift public opinion, and steer millions of dollars in advertising spend, yet forecasting which tag goes viral is elusive. Classical regressors digest surface features but ignore context, while large language models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning but misestimate numbers. We present BuzzProphet, a reasoning-augmented hashtag popularity prediction framework that (1) instructs an LLM to articulate a hashtag's topical virality, audience reach, and timing advantage; (2) utilizes these popularity-oriented rationales to enrich the input features; and (3) regresses on these inputs. To facilitate evaluation, we release HashView, a 7,532-hashtag benchmark curated from social media. Across diverse regressor-LLM combinations, BuzzProphet reduces RMSE by up to 2.8% and boosts correlation by 30% over baselines, while producing human-readable rationales. Results demonstrate that using LLMs as context reasoners rather than numeric predictors injects domain insight into tabular models, yielding an interpretable and deployable solution for social media trend forecasting.},

abstract = {Rating prediction is a core problem in recommender systems to quantify users' preferences towards items. However, rating imbalance naturally roots in real-world user ratings that cause biased predictions and lead to poor performance on tail ratings. While existing approaches in the rating prediction task deploy weighted cross-entropy to re-weight training samples, such approaches commonly assume a normal distribution, a symmetrical and balanced space. In contrast to the normal assumption, we propose a novel Gumbel-based Variational Network framework (GVN) to model rating imbalance and augment feature representations by the Gumbel distributions. We propose a Gumbel-based variational encoder to transform features into non-normal vector space. Second, we deploy a multi-scale convolutional fusion network to integrate comprehensive views of users and items from the rating matrix and user reviews. Third, we adopt a skip connection module to personalize final rating predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets with both errors- and ranking-based metrics. Experiments on ranking and regression evaluation tasks prove that the GVN can effectively achieve state-of-the-art performance across the datasets and reduce the biased predictions of tail ratings. We compare with various distributions (e.g., normal and Poisson) and demonstrate the effectiveness of Gumbel-based methods on class-imbalance modeling.

abstract = {Neural network methods have achieved great success in sentiment classification. Recent studies have found that incorporating user and product information can effectively improve the performance of review sentiment classification. However, most of these studies only concentrate on the influence of users and products, ignoring the inherent correlation between users or products. This information is important for users or products since they can obtain more information from similar users or products. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for review rating prediction with user and product memory. First, besides the original user or product representations, we construct inferred representations from representative users or products which are stored in memory slots. These memory units can be viewed as refined knowledge representations of users or products learned from the data. Then, we employ two hierarchical networks with user attention and product attention using both the original and inferred representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Besides, our approach performs much more better in cold-start scenarios where the training data is scarce.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous Information Network(HIN) has been employed in recommender system to represent heterogeneous types of data, and meta path has been proposed to capture semantic relationship among objects. When applying HIN to the recommendation, there are two problems: how to extract features from meta paths and how to properly fuse these features to further improve recommendations. Some recent work has employed deep neural network to learn user and item representation, and attention mechanism has been explored to integrate information for recommendation. Inspired by these work, in this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Neural Attentive Factorization Machine(HNAFM) to solve above problems. Specifically, we first calculate the commuting matrices based on meta paths and use multilayer perceptrons to learn user and item features. A hierarchical attention mechanism is employed to find the meta path that best describes user's preference and item's property. Comprehensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed HNAFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rating prediction methods.},

abstract = {Predicting the popularity of user-created recipes has great potential to be adopted in several applications on recipe-sharing websites. To ensure timely prediction when a recipe is uploaded, a prediction model needs to be trained based on the recipe's content features (i.e., its visual and semantic features). This paper presents a novel approach to predicting recipe popularity using deep visual-semantic fusion. We first pre-train a deep model that predicts the popularity of recipes based on each single modality. We insert additional layers to the two models and concatenate their activations. Finally, we train a network comprising fully connected (FC) layers on the fused features to learn more powerful features, which are used for training a regressor. Based on experiments conducted on more than 150K recipes collected from the Cookpad website, we present a comprehensive comparison with several baselines to verify the effectiveness of our method. The best practice for the proposed method is also described.},

abstract = {The cold-start problem, faced when providing recommendations to newly joined users with no historical interaction record existing in the platform, is one of the most critical problems that negatively impact the performance of a recommendation system. Fortunately, cross-domain recommendation~(CDR) is a promising approach for solving this problem, which can exploit the knowledge of these users from source domains to provide recommendations in the target domain. However, this method requires that the central server has the interaction behaviour data in both domains of all the users, which prevents users from participating due to privacy issues.In this work, we propose FedCDR, a federated learning based cross-domain recommendation system that effectively trains the recommendation model while keeping users' raw data and private user-specific parameters located on their own devices. Unlike existing CDR models, a personal module and a transfer module are designed to adapt to the extremely heterogeneous data on the participating devices. Specifically, the personal module extracts private user features for each user, while the transfer module is responsible for transferring the knowledge between the two domains. Moreover, in order to provide personalized recommendations with less storage and communication costs while effectively protecting privacy, we design a personalized update strategy for each client and a personalized aggregation strategy for the server. In addition, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the representative Amazon 5-cores datasets for three popular rating prediction tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of FedCDR. The results show that FedCDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). For example, in task Movie&amp;Music, FedCDR can effectively improve the performance up to 65.83% and 55.45% on MAE and RMSE, respectively, when the new users are in the movie domain.},

abstract = {This paper targets a general popularity prediction problem for event sequence, which has recently gained great attention due to its extensive applications in various domains. Feature driven method and point process method are two basic thinking paradigms to tackle the prediction problem, but both of them suffer from limitations. In this paper, we propose PreNets unifying the two thinking paradigms in an adversarial manner. On one side, feature driven model acts like a 'critic' who aims to discriminate the predicted popularity from the real one based on a set of temporal features from the sequence. On the other side, point process model acts like an 'interpreter' who recognizes the dynamic patterns in sequence to generate a predicted popularity that can fool the 'critic'. Through a Wasserstein learning based two-player game, the training loss of the 'critic' guides the 'interpreter' to better exploit the sequence patterns and enhance prediction, while the 'interpreter' pushes the 'critic' to select effective early features that helps discrimination. This mechanism enables the framework to absorb the advantages of both feature driven and point process methods. Empirical results show that PreNets achieves significant MAPE improvement for both Twitter cascade and Amazon review prediction.},

abstract = {Review rating prediction is an important task in data mining and natural language processing fields, and has wide applications. Users usually express opinions towards many aspects in their reviews, and the overall review rating is a synthesis of these opinions. However, most existing review rating prediction methods ignore users' opinions on aspects, which is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a neural aspect-aware rating prediction approach for Chinese reviews. In our approach we propose a collaborative learning framework to jointly train review-level rating predictor and multiple aspect-level rating predictors. In our framework different rating predictors share the same review encoder model to exploit the inherent relatedness between them, but have different attention networks to focus on different informative texts for each task. The final review representation for rating prediction is a concatenation of the review representations from all predictors. Since word segmentation of Chinese reviews is usually inaccurate, we propose a multi-view learning model to learn review representations from both words and characters. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Video popularity prediction plays a foundational role in many aspects of life, such as recommendation systems and investment consulting. Because of its technological and economic importance, this problem has been extensively studied for years. However, four constraints have limited most related works' usability. First, most feature oriented models are inadequate in the social media environment, because many videos are published with no specific content features, such as a strong cast or a famous script. Second, many studies assume that there is a linear correlation existing between view counts from early and later days, but this is not the case in every scenario. Third, numerous works just take view counts into consideration, but discount associated sentiments. Nevertheless, it is the public opinions that directly drive a video's final success/failure. Also, many related approaches rely on a network topology, but such topologies are unavailable in many situations. Here, we propose a Dual Sentimental Hawkes Process (DSHP) to cope with all the problems above. DSHP's innovations are reflected in three ways: (1) it breaks the "Linear Correlation" assumption, and implements Hawkes Process; (2) it reveals deeper factors that affect a video's popularity; and (3) it is topology free. We evaluate DSHP on four types of videos: Movies, TV Episodes, Music Videos, and Online News, and compare its performance against 6 widely used models, including Translation Model, Multiple Linear Regression, KNN Regression, ARMA, Reinforced Poisson Process, and Univariate Hawkes Process. Our model outperforms all of the others, which indicates a promising application prospect.},

abstract = {Predicting popularity, or the total volume of information outbreaks, is an important subproblem for understanding collective behavior in networks. Each of the two main types of recent approaches to the problem, feature-driven and generative models, have desired qualities and clear limitations. This paper bridges the gap between these solutions with a new hybrid approach and a new performance benchmark. We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. To our surprise, Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches on existing tweet data [44] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. From these observations, we argue that future work on popularity prediction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling approaches in both classification and regression tasks.},

abstract = {Popularity prediction, with both technological and economic importance, has been extensively studied for conventional video sharing sites (VSSes), where the videos are mainly found via searching, browsing, or related links. Recent statistics however suggest that online social network (OSN) users regularly share video contents from VSSes, which has contributed to a significant portion of the accesses; yet the popularity prediction in this new context remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present an initial study on the popularity prediction of videos propagated in OSNs along friendship links.We conduct a large-scale measurement and analysis of viewing patterns of videos shared in one of largest OSNs in China, and examine the performance of typical views-based prediction models. We find that they are generally ineffective, if not totally fail, especially when predicting the early peaks and later bursts of accesses, which are common during video propagations in OSNs. To overcome these limits, we track the propagation process of videos shared in a Facebook-like OSN in China, and analyze the user viewing and sharing behaviors. We accordingly develop a novel propagation-based video popularity prediction solution, namely SoVP. Instead of relying solely on the early views for prediction, SoVP considers both the intrinsic attractiveness of a video and the influence from the underlying propagation structure. The effectiveness of SoVP, particularly for predicting the peaks and bursts, have been validated through our trace-driven experiments.},

abstract = {User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user will provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking on an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such as online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. For these tasks and many other machine learning tasks, an indispensable part of success is feature engineering, where cross features are a significant type of feature transformations. However, due to the high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these tasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies in predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing feature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order cross features, either explicitly or implicitly. However, these existing methods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model architecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with equal weights. Different features should contribute differently to the prediction, and not all cross features are with the same prediction power.This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel architecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross network's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at the vector-wise level. By computing the inner product or outer product between attentional feature embeddings and original input embeddings as each layer's output, we can model cross features with a higher degree of order as the network's depth increases. We concatenate all the outputs from each layer, which further helps the model capture much information on cross features of different orders. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of different cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head attention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to perform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed model can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly demonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.

abstract = {Review rating is more helpful than review binary classification for many decision processes such as consumption decision-making, company product quality tracking and public opinion mining. In the review rating, reviewers are influenced not only by their own subjective feelings, but also by others' rating to the same product. Existing review rating prediction methods are mainly based on the content of reviews, which only consider the subjective factors of reviewers, but not consider the impact of other people in the social relations of reviewers. Based on it, we propose a review rating prediction method by incorporating the character of reviewer's social relations, as regularization constraints, into content-based methods. In addition, we further propose a method to classify the social relations of reviewers into strong social relation and ordinary social relation. For strong social relation of reviewers, we give higher weight than ordinary social relation when incorporating the two social relations into content-based methods. Experiments on two real movie review datasets demonstrate that the method of considering different social relations has better performance than the content-based methods and the method of considering social relations as a whole.},

In this paper we first present a Bayesian latent variable model for rating prediction that models ratings over each user's latent interests and also each item's latent topics. We describe a Gibbs sampling procedure that can be used to estimate its parameters and show by experiment that it is competitive with the gradient descent SVD methods commonly used in state-of-the-art systems. We then proceed to make an important and novel extension to this model, enhancing it with user-dependent and item-dependant biases to significantly improve rating estimation. We show by experiment on a large set of real ratings data that these models are able to outperform 3 common baselines, including a very competitive and modern SVD-based model. Furthermore we illustrate other advantages of our approach beyond simply its ability to provide more accurate ratings and show that it is able to perform better on the common and important case where the user profile is short.},

abstract = {Many amateur creators now create derivative works and put them on the web. Although there are several factors that inspire the creation of derivative works, such factors cannot usually be observed on the web. In this paper, we propose a model for inferring latent factors from sequences of derivative work posting events. We assume a sequence to be a stochastic process incorporating the following three factors: (1) the original work's attractiveness, (2) the original work's popularity, and (3) the derivative work's popularity. To characterize content popularity, we use content ranking data and incorporate rank-biased popularity based on the creators' browsing behavior. Our main contributions are three-fold: (1) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling derivative creation activity, (2) by using a real-world dataset of music-related derivative work creation to evaluate our model, we showed the effectiveness of adopting all three factors to model derivative creation activity and onsidering creators' browsing behavior, and (3) we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that our model is useful in analyzing derivative creation activity in terms of category characteristics, temporal development of factors that trigger derivative work posting events, etc.},

abstract = {Online content popularity prediction provides substantial value to a broad range of applications in the end-to-end social media systems, from network resource allocation to targeted advertising. While using historical popularity can predict the near-term popularity with a reasonable accuracy, the bursty nature of online content popularity evolution makes it difficult to capture the correlation between historical data and future data in the long term. Although various existing efforts have been made toward long-term prediction, they need to accumulate a long enough historical data before the prediction and their model assumptions cannot be applied to the complex YouTube networks with inherent unpredictability.In this paper, we aim to achieve fast prediction of long-term video popularity in the complex YouTube networks. We propose LARM, a lifetime aware regression model, representing the first work that leverages content lifetime to compensate the insufficiency of historical data without assumptions of network structure. The proposed LARM is empowered by a lifetime metric that is both predictable via early-accessible features and adaptable to different observation intervals, as well as a set of specialized regression models to handle different classes of videos with different lifetime. We validate LARM on two YouTube data sets with hourly and daily observation intervals. Experimental results indicate that LARM outperforms several non-trivial baselines from the literature by up to 20% and 18% of prediction error reduction in the two data sets.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been gaining increasing research attention over the years. Most existing recommendation methods focus on capturing users' personalized preferences through historical user-item interactions, which may potentially violate user privacy. Additionally, these approaches often overlook the significance of the temporal fluctuation in item popularity that can sway users' decision-making. To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems. Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial applications and a valuable baseline for future research.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been widely applied for personalized recommendations in various industrial applications. However, due to the training strategy of Empirical Risk Minimization, CF models tend to favor popular items, resulting in inferior performance on sparse users and items. To enhance the CF representation learning of sparse users and items without sacrificing the performance of popular items, we propose a novel Popularity- aware Distributionally Robust Optimization (PDRO) framework. In particular, PDRO emphasizes the optimization of sparse users/items, while incorporating item popularity to preserve the performance of popular items through two modules. First, an implicit module develops a new popularity-aware DRO objective, paying more attention to items that will potentially become popular over time. Second, an explicit module that directly predicts the popularity of items to help the estimation of user-item matching scores. We apply PDRO to a micro-video recommendation scenario and implement it on two representative backend models. Extensive experiments on a real-world industrial dataset, as well as two public benchmark datasets, validate the efficacy of our proposed PDRO. Additionally, we perform an offline A/B test on the industrial dataset, further demonstrating the superiority of PDRO in real-world application scenarios.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommender systems but face challenges from inherent noise, sparsity, and Euclidean geometry's inadequacy for complex relational structures, critically impairing representation learning, especially for long-tail entities. Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation.

abstract = {Review-based methods are one of the dominant methods to address the data sparsity problem of recommender system. However, the performance of most existing review-based methods will degrade when the review is also sparse. To this end, we propose a method to exploit user-item p air-dependent features from a uxiliary r eviews written by l ike-minded users (PARL) to address such problem. That is, both the reviews written by the user and the reviews written for the item are incorporated to highlight the useful features covered by the auxiliary reviews. PARL not only alleviates the sparsity problem of reviews but also produce extra informative features to further improve the accuracy of rating prediction. More importantly, it is designed as a plug-and-play model which can be plugged into various deep recommender systems to improve recommendations provided by them. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PARL achieves better prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with the exploitation of auxiliary reviews, the performance of PARL is robust on datasets with different characteristics.},

abstract = {Online social media remarkably facilitates the production and delivery of information, intensifying the competition among vast information for users' attention and highlighting the importance of predicting the popularity of information. Existing approaches for popularity prediction fall into two paradigms: feature-based approaches and generative approaches. Feature-based approaches extract various features (e.g., user, content, structural, and temporal features), and predict the future popularity of information by training a regression/classification model. Their predictive performance heavily depends on the quality of hand-crafted features. In contrast, generative approaches devote to characterizing and modeling the process that a piece of information accrues attentions, offering us high ease to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the popularity dynamics of information cascades. But they have less desirable predictive power since they are not optimized for popularity prediction. In this paper, we propose DeepHawkes to combat the defects of existing methods, leveraging end-to-end deep learning to make an analogy to interpretable factors of Hawkes process --- a widely-used generative process to model information cascade. DeepHawkes inherits the high interpretability of Hawkes process and possesses the high predictive power of deep learning methods, bridging the gap between prediction and understanding of information cascades. We verify the effectiveness of DeepHawkes by applying it to predict retweet cascades of Sina Weibo and citation cascades of a longitudinal citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepHawkes outperforms both feature-based and generative approaches.},

Current fairness studies primarily examine two independent dimensions: user-side fairness and item-side fairness. However, most approaches address each side's fairness in isolation while neglecting their complex interdependencies. In this paper, we propose an LLM-Enhanced DiscriminAtive Counterfactual Debiasing Model for Two-sided Fairness in Recommendation (LeadFairRec). Specifically, we first design a two-sided causal graph that jointly models provider-customer fairness interactions through their causal relationships. Then we propose a discriminative counterfactual debiasing method, which effectively removes spurious correlations while maintaining true user-item interactions. Finally, we propose an LLM-enhanced counterfactual inference method to derive noise-resistant user/item representations from interaction data, enhancing the robustness of causal debiasing. The experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of our proposed model. We provide our code at https://github.com/houyimin660/LeadFairRec.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid prevalence of online serials, which play an important role in our daily entertainment. A critical demand along this line is to predict the popularity of online serials, which can enable a wide range of applications, such as online advertising, and serial recommendation. However, compared with traditional online media such as user-generated content (UGC), online serials have unique characteristics of sequence dependence, release date dependence as well as unsynchronized update regularity. Therefore, the popularity prediction for online serials is a nontrivial task and still under-addressed. To this end, in this paper we present a comprehensive study for predicting the popularity of online serials with autoregressive models. Specifically, we first introduce a straightforward yet effective Naive Autoregressive (NAR) model based on the correlations of serial episodes. Furthermore, we develop a sophisticated model, namely Transfer Autoregressive (TAR) model, to capture the dynamic behaviors of audiences, which can achieve better prediction performance than the NAR model. Indeed, the two models can reveal the popularity generation from different perspectives. In addition, as a derivative of the TAR model, we also design a novel metric, namely favor, for evaluating the quality of online serials. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world data sets clearly show that both models are effective and outperform baselines in terms of the popularity prediction for online serials. And the new metric performs better than other metrics for quality estimation.},

abstract = {Item popularity in real-world data follows a long-tail distribution, where a few items attract most of the attention, while the majority receive much less. This disparity results in high-quality embeddings for popular (head) items, but lower-quality embeddings for unpopular (tail) items, leading to less accurate recommendations for the latter. Our observations confirm that embeddings of tail items often exhibit (1) magnitudes (i.e., norms) that are less reflective of actual popularity and (2) directions that are less effective in capturing user preferences, compared to those of head items.To address this issue, we propose EDGE, a post-training embedding enhancement method for long-tail recommendations. EDGE employs two key strategies: (1) refining embedding magnitudes to better reflect item popularity and (2) adjusting embedding directions by leveraging knowledge from head items. Importantly, EDGE is model-agnostic and can be applied to embeddings learned from any trained recommender system. Experimental results show that EDGE significantly improves tail item recommendation performance and overall system performance, achieving up to an improvement of 211.23% in NDCG@20 over the state-of-the-art method.

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is the basic method for recommendation with implicit feedback. Recently, various state-of-the-art CF integrates graph neural networks. However, they often suffer from popularity bias, causing recommendations to deviate from users' genuine preferences. Additionally, several contrastive learning methods based on the in-batch sample strategy have been proposed to train the CF model effectively, but they are prone to suffering from sample bias. To address this problem, debiased contrastive loss has been employed in the recommendation, but instead of personalized debiasing, it treats each user equally. In this paper, we propose a popularity-aware debiased contrastive loss for CF, which can adaptively correct the positive and negative scores based on the popularity of users and items. Our approach aims to reduce the negative impact of popularity and sample bias simultaneously. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal the relationship between popularity and gradient, which justifies the correction strategy. We extensively evaluate our method on three public benchmarks over balanced and imbalanced settings. The results demonstrate its superiority over the existing debiased strategies, not only on the entire datasets but also when segmenting the datasets based on item popularity.},

Nevertheless, almost all recommender works are focused on how to describe user preferences by the implicit click/like interactions, to find the synergy of people. For the content-based explicit comments/reviews interactions, some works attempt to utilize them to mine the semantic knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, they still neglect the following two points: (1) The content semantic is a universal world knowledge; how do we extract the multi-aspect semantic information to empower different domains? (2) The user/item ID feature is a fundamental element for recommender models; how do we align the ID and content semantic feature space? In this paper, we propose a 'plugin' semantic knowledge transferring method LoID, which includes two major components: (1) LoRA-based large language model pretraining to extract multi-aspect semantic information; (2) ID-based contrastive objective to align their feature spaces. We conduct extensive experiments with SOTA baselines to demonstrate superiority of our method LoID.},

abstract = {The field of generating recommendations within the framework of causal inference has seen a recent surge.This approach enhances insights into the influence of recommendations on user behavior and helps in identifying the underlying factors. Existing research has often leveraged propensity scores to mitigate bias, albeit at the risk of introducing additional variance. Others have explored the use of unbiased data from randomized controlled trials, although this comes with assumptions that may prove challenging in practice. In this paper, we first present the causality-aware interpretation of recommendations and reveal how the underlying exposure mechanism can bias the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of observational feedback. Recognizing that confounders may be elusive, we propose a contrastive self-supervised learning to minimize exposure bias, employing inverse propensity scores and expanding the positive sample set. Building on this foundation, we present a novel contrastive counterfactual learning method (CCL) that incorporates three unique positive sampling strategies grounded in estimated exposure probability or random counterfactual samples. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our CCL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Temporal point process (TPP) models have hitherto been moderately good at nowcasting hashtag popularity, but have been very poor at forecasting due to insufficient modeling of Twitter microdynamics. Recent studies have shown that the highly fluctuating nature of hashtag popularity dynamics is due to the influence of two external factors: (i) hashtag-tweet reinforcement and (ii) inter-hashtag competition. In this paper, we propose a marked TPP based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which can seamlessly incorporate the assistive information necessary to capture the above effects and successfully forecast distant popularity trends. To achieve this, we employ a unique linear semi-autoregressive model for mark generation and couple the time and mark generative aspects. On seven diverse datasets crawled from Twitter covering several real-world events, our model yields remarkably stable performance in predicting hashtag popularity in diverse situations and offers a substantial improvement over the existing state of the art generative models.},

In this work, we propose 'Test Time Embedding Normalization' as a simple yet effective strategy for mitigating popularity bias, which surpasses the performance of the previous mitigation approaches by a significant margin. Our approach utilizes the normalized item embedding during the inference stage to control the influence of embedding magnitude, which is highly correlated with item popularity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method combined with the sampled softmax loss effectively reduces popularity bias compare to previous approaches for bias mitigation. We further investigate the relationship between user and item embeddings and find that the angular similarity between embeddings distinguishes preferable and non-preferable items regardless of their popularity. The analysis explains the mechanism behind the success of our approach in eliminating the impact of popularity bias. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/TTEN.},

Unveiling underlying diffusion processes is very challenging, since a social system consists of time-evolving subgroups interacting and exerting disproportionate influences on an individual item's popularity. In this study, we propose the Affinity Poisson Process model (APP) which models popularity dynamics, by incorporating (1) affinities between subgroups, (2) heterogeneous preferential attachment, and (3) subgroup-level time decay. As a case study, we apply our proposed model to scholarly publications in computer science. Our model outperforms the state of the art approach in predicting citation volumes of individual papers. More importantly, the proposed model enables us to uncover popularity dynamics driven by intra- and inter-subgroup interactions, which has been neglected in prior work. We expect that our model can afford interpretable insights on the attention economy in terms of affinity and aging effect.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in Collaborative Filtering (CF). However, when given a new recommendation scenario, the current options are either selecting from existing GNN architectures or employing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain a well-performing GNN model, both of which are expensive in terms of human expertise or computational resources.To address the problem, in this work,we propose a novel neural retrieval approach, dubbed RGCF, to search a well-performing architecture for GNN-based CF rapidly when handling new scenarios. Specifically, we design the neural retrieval approach based on meta-learning by developing two-level meta-features, ranking loss, and task-level data augmentation, and in a retrieval paradigm, RGCF can directly return a well-performing architecture given a new dataset (query), thus being efficient inherently. Experimental results on two mainstream tasks, i.e., rating prediction and item ranking, show that RGCF outperforms all models either by human-designed or NAS on two new datasets in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Particularly, the efficiency improvement is significant, taking as an example that RGCF is 61.7-206.3x faster than a typical reinforcement learning based NAS approach on the two new datasets.

abstract = {Aspect-based opinion mining, which aims to extract aspects and their corresponding ratings from customers reviews, provides very useful information for customers to make purchase decisions. In the past few years several probabilistic graphical models have been proposed to address this problem, most of them based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). While these models have a lot in common, there are some characteristics that distinguish them from each other. These fundamental differences correspond to major decisions that have been made in the design of the LDA models. While research papers typically claim that a new model outperforms the existing ones, there is normally no "one-size-fits-all" model. In this paper, we present a set of design guidelines for aspect-based opinion mining by discussing a series of increasingly sophisticated LDA models. We argue that these models represent the essence of the major published methods and allow us to distinguish the impact of various design decisions. We conduct extensive experiments on a very large real life dataset from Epinions.com (500K reviews) and compare the performance of different models in terms of the likelihood of the held-out test set and in terms of the accuracy of aspect identification and rating prediction.},

abstract = {Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have shown great success in accurately capturing a user's current and detailed preference through the multi-round interaction cycle while effectively guiding users to a more personalized recommendation. Perhaps surprisingly, conversational recommender systems can be plagued by popularity bias, much like traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of popularity bias in CRSs. We demonstrate the existence of popularity bias in existing state-of-the-art CRSs from an exposure rate, a success rate, and a conversational utility perspective, and propose a suite of popularity bias metrics designed specifically for the CRS setting. We then introduce a debiasing framework with three unique features: (i) Popularity-Aware Focused Learning, to reduce the popularity-distorting impact on preference prediction; (ii) Cold-Start Item Embedding Reconstruction via Attribute Mapping, to improve the modeling of cold-start items; and (iii) Dual-Policy Learning, to better guide the CRS when dealing with either popular or unpopular items. Through extensive experiments on two frequently used CRS datasets, we find the proposed model-agnostic debiasing framework not only mitigates the popularity bias in state-of-the-art CRSs but also improves the overall recommendation performance.},

Though the concept of attention is subjective, the number of comments received by a post serves as a very good indicator of the same. Unlike previous work which primarily made use of either content features or the network features (friendship links on the network), we exploit both the content features and community level features (for instance, what time of the day is the community more active) for tackling this problem. Further, we focus on dedicated pages of corporate brands on social media websites and accordingly extract important features from the content and community activity of such brand pages. The attention prediction task finds direct application in the listening, monitoring and engaging activities of the businesses that have such brand-pages. In this paper, we formulate the problem of attention prediction on social media brand pages.We further propose Attention Prediction (AP) framework which integrates the various features that influence the attention received by a post using classification and regression based approaches. Experimental results on real world data extracted from some highly active brand pages on Facebook demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Personalized recommender systems are critical for enhancing user engagement across a range of digital platforms. However, conventional approaches rely heavily on centralized data collection, raising significant privacy concerns. Federated recommender systems (PFRS) address these concerns by decentralizing model training, ensuring user data privacy. Despite the progress, existing methods still struggle with capturing the multi-faceted nature of user and transferring global knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose FedMUR, a novel federated recommendation framework that models user representation as a Gaussian mixture distribution, capturing users' multi-faceted characteristics. Each Gaussian component corresponds to a distinct interest facet, with adaptive mixture weights representing the user's preference intensity toward each facet. To facilitate knowledge transfer, FedMUR constructs global consistent prototypes that encode shared behavioral trends across users via popularity-weighted optimal transport. These prototypes enhance local models by injecting global shared patterns into personalized representation learning. Extensive experiments across several real-world datasets demonstrate that FedMUR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated recommendation systems.},

abstract = {It is well-known that online behavior is long-tailed, with most cascaded actions being short and a few being very long. A prominent drawback in generative models for online events is the inability to describe unpopular items well. This work addresses these shortcomings by proposing dual mixture self-exciting processes to jointly learn from groups of cascades. We first start from the observation that maximum likelihood estimates for content virality and influence decay are separable in a Hawkes process. Next, our proposed model, which leverages a Borel mixture model and a kernel mixture model, jointly models the unfolding of a heterogeneous set of cascades. When applied to cascades of the same online items, the model directly characterizes their spread dynamics and supplies interpretable quantities, such as content virality and content influence decay, as well as methods for predicting the final content popularities. On two retweet cascade datasets --- one relating to YouTube videos and the second relating to controversial news articles --- we show that our models capture the differences between online items at the granularity of items, publishers and categories. In particular, we are able to distinguish between far-right, conspiracy, controversial and reputable online news articles based on how they diffuse through social media, achieving an F1 score of 0.945. On holdout datasets, we show that the dual mixture model provides, for reshare diffusion cascades especially unpopular ones, better generalization performance and, for online items, accurate item popularity predictions.},

abstract = {Graph-based recommender systems leverage neighborhood aggregation to generate node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.},

However, despite being extensively studied, these methods still suffer from two limitations. First, previous studies either encode the document or extract latent sentiment via neural networks, which are difficult to interpret the sentiment of reviewers intuitively. Second, they neglect the personalized interaction of reviews with user/item, i.e., each review has different contributions when modeling the preference of user/item To remedy these issues, we propose a Sentiment-aware Interactive Fusion Network (SIFN) for review-based item recommendation. Specifically, we first encode user/item reviews via BERT and propose a light-weighted sentiment learner to extract semantic features of each review. Then, we propose a sentiment prediction task that guides the sentiment learner to extract sentiment-aware features via explicit sentiment labels. Finally, we design a rating prediction task that contains a rating learner with an interactive and fusion module to fuse the identity (i.e., user and item ID) and each review representation so that various interactive features can synergistically influence the final rating score. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) tend to recommend more popular items instead of the relevant long-tail items. Mitigating such popularity bias is crucial to ensure that less popular but relevant items are part of the recommendation list shown to the user. In this work, we study the phenomenon of popularity bias in session-based RS (SRS) obtained via deep learning (DL) models. We observe that DL models trained on the historical user-item interactions in session logs (having long-tailed item-click distributions) tend to amplify popularity bias. To understand the source of this bias amplification, we consider potential sources of bias at two distinct stages in the modeling process: i. the data-generation stage (user-item interactions captured as session logs), ii. the DL model training stage. We highlight that the popularity of an item has a causal effect on i. user-item interactions via conformity bias, as well as ii. item ranking from DL models via biased training process due to class (target item) imbalance. While most existing approaches in literature address only one of these effects, we consider a comprehensive causal inference framework that identifies and mitigates the effects at both stages. Through extensive empirical evaluation on simulated and real-world datasets, we show that our approach improves upon several strong baselines from literature for popularity bias and long-tailed classification. Ablation studies show the advantage of our comprehensive causal analysis to identify and handle bias in data generation as well as training stages.},

Existing approaches mainly adhere to three categories of loss functions: pairwise, pointwise, and setwise loss functions. Despite their effectiveness, a critical and common drawback of such objectives is viewing the next observed item as a unique positive while considering all remaining items equally negative. Such a binary label assignment is generally limited to assuring a higher recommendation score of the positive item, neglecting potential structures induced by varying preferences between other unobserved items. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel method that extends original objectives to explicitly leverage the different levels of preferences as relative orders between their scores. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to baseline objectives.},

abstract = {Representation learning in sequential recommendation is critical for accurately modeling user interaction patterns and improving recommendation precision. However, existing approaches predominantly emphasize item-to-item transitions, often neglecting the time intervals between interactions, which are closely related to behavior pattern changes. Additionally, broader interaction attributes, such as item frequency, are frequently overlooked. We found that both sequences with more uniform time intervals and items with higher frequency yield better prediction performance. Conversely, non-uniform sequences exacerbate user interest drift and less-frequent items are difficult to model due to sparse sampling, presenting unique challenges inadequately addressed by current methods. In this paper, we propose UniRec, a novel bidirectional enhancement sequential recommendation method. UniRec leverages sequence uniformity and item frequency to enhance performance, particularly improving the representation of non-uniform sequences and less-frequent items. These two branches mutually reinforce each other, driving comprehensive performance optimization in complex sequential recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we present a multidimensional time module to further enhance adaptability. To the best of our knowledge, UniRec is the first method to utilize the characteristics of uniformity and frequency for feature augmentation. Comparing with eleven advanced models across four datasets, we demonstrate that UniRec outperforms SOTA models significantly. The code is available at https://github.com/Linxi000/UniRec.},

abstract = {Mining customer reviews (opinion mining) has emerged as an interesting new research direction. Most of the reviewing websites such as Epinions.com provide some additional information on top of the review text and overall rating, including a set of predefined aspects and their ratings, and a rating guideline which shows the intended interpretation of the numerical ratings. However, the existing methods have ignored this additional information. We claim that using this information, which is freely available, along with the review text can effectively improve the accuracy of opinion mining. We propose an unsupervised method, called Opinion Digger, which extracts important aspects of a product and determines the overall consumer's satisfaction for each, by estimating a rating in the range from 1 to 5. We demonstrate the improved effectiveness of our methods on a real life dataset that we crawled from Epinions.com.},

abstract = {News recommendation is of vital importance to alleviating in-formation overload. Recent research shows that precise modeling of news content and user interests become critical for news rec-ommendation. Existing methods usually utilize information such as news title, abstract, entities to predict Click Through Rate(CTR) or add some auxiliary tasks to a multi-task learning framework. However, none of them directly consider predicted news popularity and the degree of users' attention to popular news into the CTR prediction results. Meanwhile, multiple inter-ests may arise throughout users' browsing history. Thus it is hard to represent user interests via a single user vector. In this paper, we propose PENR, a Popularity-Enhanced News Recommenda-tion method, which integrates popularity prediction task to im-prove the performance of the news encoder. News popularity score is predicted and added to the final CTR, while news popu-larity is utilized to model the degree of users' tendency to follow hot news. Moreover, user interests are modeled from different perspectives via a subspace projection method that assembles the browsing history to multiple subspaces. In this way, we capture users' multi-view interest representations. Experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our PENR approach.},

abstract = {Search clarification has recently attracted much attention due to its applications in search engines. It has also been recognized as a major component in conversational information seeking systems. Despite its importance, the research community still feels the lack of a large-scale dataset for studying different aspects of search clarification. In this paper, we introduce MIMICS, a collection of search clarification datasets for real web search queries sampled from the Bing query logs. Each clarification in MIMICS is generated by a Bing production algorithm and consists of a clarifying question and up to five candidate answers. MIMICS contains three datasets: (1) MIMICS-Click includes over 400k unique queries, their associated clarification panes, and the corresponding aggregated user interaction signals (i.e., clicks). (2) MIMICS-ClickExplore is an exploration data that includes aggregated user interaction signals for over 60k unique queries, each with multiple clarification panes. (3) MIMICS-Manual includes over 2k unique real search queries. Each query-clarification pair in this dataset has been manually labeled by at least three trained annotators. It contains graded quality labels for the clarifying question, the candidate answer set, and the landing result page for each candidate answer.  MIMICS is publicly available for research purposes, thus enables researchers to study a number of tasks related to search clarification, including clarification generation and selection, user engagement prediction for clarification, click models for clarification, and analyzing user interactions with search clarification. We also release the results returned by the Bing's web search API for all the queries in MIMICS. This would allow researchers to utilize search results for the tasks related to search clarification.},

However, such an architecture isolates the information exchange between two encoders, resulting in suboptimal recommendation accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel two-tower style Neural Recommendation with Cross-modality Mutual Attention (NRCMA), which bridges user encoder and item encoder crossing reviews and ratings, in order to select informative words and reviews to learn better representation for users and items. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the cross-modality mutual attention is beneficial to two-tower neural networks, and NRCMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art review-aware item recommendation techniques.},

Although existing studies have made great efforts to learn urban region representation from multi-source urban data, there are still limitations on modelling local-level signals, developing an effective yet integrated fusion framework, and performing well in regions with high variance socioeconomic attributes. Thus, we propose a multi-graph representation learning framework, called Region2Vec, for urban region profiling. Specifically, except that human mobility is encoded for inter-region relations, geographic neighborhood is introduced for capturing geographical contextual information while POI side information is adopted for representing intra-region information. Then, graphs are used to capture accessibility, vicinity, and functionality correlations among regions. An encoder-decoder multi-graph fusion module is further proposed to jointly learn comprehensive representations. Experiments on real-world datasets show that Region2Vec can be employed in three applications and outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, Region2Vec has better performance than previous studies in regions with high variance socioeconomic attributes.},

abstract = {Transformer-based sequential recommendation (SR) has been booming in recent years, with the self-attention mechanism as its key component. Self-attention has been widely believed to be able to effectively select those informative and relevant items from a sequence of interacted items for next-item prediction via learning larger attention weights for these items. However, this may not always be true in reality. Our empirical analysis of some representative Transformer-based SR models reveals that it is not uncommon for large attention weights to be assigned to less relevant items, which can result in inaccurate recommendations. Through further in-depth analysis, we find two factors that may contribute to such inaccurate assignment of attention weights:sub-optimal position encoding andnoisy input. To this end, in this paper, we aim to address this significant yet challenging gap in existing works. To be specific, we propose a simple yet effective framework called Attention Calibration for Transformer-based Sequential Recommendation (AC-TSR). In AC-TSR, a novel spatial calibrator and adversarial calibrator are designed respectively to directly calibrates those incorrectly assigned attention weights. The former is devised to explicitly capture the spatial relationships (i.e., order and distance) among items for more precise calculation of attention weights. The latter aims to redistribute the attention weights based on each item's contribution to the next-item prediction. AC-TSR is readily adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into various existing transformer-based SR models. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AC-TSR via significant recommendation performance enhancements.

abstract = {For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most important tasks in E-commerce. It is often the case that users' interests different from their past routines may emerge or impressions such as promotional items may burst in a very short period. In essence, such changes relate to item evolution problem, which has not been investigated by previous studies. The state-of-the-art methods in the sequential recommendation, which use simple user behaviors, are incapable of modeling these changes sufficiently. It is because, in the user behaviors, outdated interests may exist and the popularity of an item over time is not well represented. To address these limitations, we introduce time-aware item behaviors for addressing the recommendation of emerging preference. The time-aware item behavior for an item is a set of users who interact with this item with timestamps. The rich interaction information of users for an item may help to model its evolution. In this work, we propose a CTR prediction model TIEN based on the time-aware item behavior. In TIEN, by leveraging the interaction time intervals, information of similar users in a short time interval helps identify the emerging user interest of the target user. By using the sequential time intervals, the item's popularity over time can be captured in evolutionary item dynamics. Noisy users who interact with items accidentally are further eliminated thus learning robust personalized item dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to the item evolution problem for E-commerce CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world CTR prediction datasets. The results show that the TIEN model consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Sequential recommendation has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to accurately capture the dynamic changes in user interests. We have noticed that generative models, especially diffusion models, which have achieved significant results in fields like image and audio, hold considerable promise in the field of sequential recommendation. However, existing sequential recommendation methods based on diffusion models are constrained by a prior distribution limited to Gaussian distribution, hindering the possibility of introducing user-specific information for each recommendation and leading to information loss. To address these issues, we introduce the Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge into diffusion-based sequential recommendation models, creating the SdifRec model. This allows us to replace the Gaussian prior of the diffusion model with the user's current state, directly modeling the process from a user's current state to the target recommendation. Additionally, to better utilize collaborative information in recommendations, we propose an extended version of SdifRec called con-SdifRec, which utilizes user clustering information as a guiding condition to further enhance the posterior distribution. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of SdifRec and con-SdifRec through comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. Further in-depth analysis has validated their efficiency and robustness.},

abstract = {Interpretability of recommender systems has caused increasing attention due to its promotion of the effectiveness and persuasiveness of recommendation decision, and thus user satisfaction. Most existing methods, such as Matrix Factorization (MF), tend to be black-box machine learning models that lack interpretability and do not provide a straightforward explanation for their outputs. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic factorization model and further assume the absence of any auxiliary information, such as item content or user review. We propose an influence mechanism to evaluate the importance of the users' historical data, so that the most related users and items can be selected to explain each predicted rating. The proposed method is thus called Influencebased Interpretable Recommendation model (In2Rec). To further enhance the recommendation accuracy, we address the important issue of missing not at random, i.e., missing ratings are not independent from the observed and other unobserved ratings, because users tend to only interact what they like. In2Rec models the generative process for both observed and missing data, and integrates the influence mechanism in a Bayesian graphical model. A learning algorithm capitalizing on iterated condition modes is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem pertaining to maximum a posteriori estimation for In2Rec. A series of experiments on four real-world datasets (Movielens 10M, Netflix, Epinions, and Yelp) have been conducted. By comparing with the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, the experimental results have shown that In2Rec can consistently benefit the recommendation system in both rating prediction and ranking estimation tasks, and friendly interpret the recommendation results with the aid of the proposed influence mechanism.},

abstract = {In Reinforcement Learning-based Recommender Systems (RLRS), the complexity and dynamism of user interactions often result in high-dimensional and noisy state spaces, making it challenging to discern which aspects of the state are truly influential in driving the decision-making process. This issue is exacerbated by the evolving nature of user preferences and behaviors, requiring the recommender system to adaptively focus on the most relevant information for decision-making while preserving generaliability. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative causal approach for decomposing the state and extracting Causal-InDispensable State Representations (CIDS) in RLRS. Our method concentrates on identifying the Directly Action-Influenced State Variables (DAIS) and Action-Influence Ancestors (AIA), which are essential for making effective recommendations. By leveraging conditional mutual information, we develop a framework that not only discerns the causal relationships within the generative process but also isolates critical state variables from the typically dense and high-dimensional state representations. We provide theoretical evidence for the identifiability of these variables. Then, by making use of the identified causal relationship, we construct causal-indispensable state representations, enabling the training of policies over a more advantageous subset of the agent's state space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments, showcasing our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Most contextual models assume that the context shares the same latent space with the users and items. In this work we propose CARS2, a novel approach for learning context-aware representations for context-aware recommendations. We show that the context-aware representations can be learned using an appropriate model that aims to represent the type of interactions between context variables, users and items. We adapt the CARS2 algorithms to explicit feedback data by using a quadratic loss function for rating prediction, and to implicit feedback data by using a pairwise and a listwise ranking loss functions for top-N recommendations. By using stochastic gradient descent for parameter estimation we ensure scalability. Experimental evaluation shows that our CARS2 models achieve competitive recommendation performance, compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Recommender systems typically represent users and items by learning their embeddings, which are usually set to uniform dimensions and dominate the model parameters. However, real-world recommender systems often operate in streaming recommendation scenarios, where the number of users and items continues to grow, leading to substantial storage resource consumption for these embeddings. Although a few methods attempt to mitigate this by employing embedding size search strategies to assign different embedding dimensions in streaming recommendations, they assume that the embedding size grows with the frequency of users/items, which eventually still exceeds the predefined memory budget over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn Scalable Lightweight Embeddings for streaming recommendation, called SCALL, which can adaptively adjust the embedding sizes of users/items within a given memory budget over time. Specifically, we propose to sample embedding sizes from a probabilistic distribution, with the guarantee to meet any predefined memory budget. By fixing the memory budget, the proposed embedding size sampling strategy can increase and decrease the embedding sizes in accordance to the frequency of the corresponding users or items. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning-based search paradigm that models each state with mean pooling to keep the length of the state vectors fixed, invariant to the changing number of users and items. As a result, the proposed method can provide embedding sizes to unseen users and items. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two public datasets affirm the advantageous effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RSs) tasks are moving from computing a ranking of final results based on a single metric to multi-objective problems. Solving these problems leads to a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, known as Pareto frontier, in which no objective can be further improved without hurting the others. In principle, all the points on the Pareto frontier are potential candidates to represent the best model selected with respect to the combination of two, or more, metrics. To our knowledge, there are no well-recognized strategies to decide which point should be selected on the frontier in IR and RSs. In this paper, we propose a novel, post-hoc, theoretically-justified technique, named "Population Distance from Utopia" (PDU), to identify and select the one-best Pareto-optimal solution. PDU considers fine-grained utopia points, and measures how far each point is from its utopia point, allowing to select solutions tailored to user preferences, a novel feature we call "calibration". We compare PDU against state-of-the-art strategies through extensive experiments on tasks from both IR and RS, showing that PDU combined with calibration notably impacts the solution selection.},

Previous research on this mainly focused on either learning a supervised model with semantic features extracted from the user's responses, or training a policy network to control the dialogue state. However, none of them has considered the issue of popularity bias in a CRS. This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop popularity debiasing framework that integrates real-time semantic understanding of open-ended user utterances as well as historical records, while also effectively managing the dialogue with the user. This allows the CRS to balance the recommendation performance as well as the item popularity so as to avoid the well-known "long-tail'' effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via experiments on two conversational recommendation datasets, and the results confirm that our proposed approach achieves high-accuracy recommendation while mitigating popularity bias.},

abstract = {Textual data is common and informative auxiliary information for recommender systems. Most prior art utilizes text for rating prediction, but rare work connects it to top-recommendation. Moreover, although advanced recommendation models capable of incorporating auxiliary information have been developed, none of these are specifically designed to model textual information, yielding a limited usage scenario for typical user-to-item recommendation. In this work, we present a framework of text-aware preference ranking (TPR) for top- recommendation, in which we comprehensively model the joint association of user-item interaction and relations between items and associated text. Using the TPR framework, we construct a joint likelihood function that explicitly describes two ranking structures: 1) item preference ranking (IPR) and 2) word relatedness ranking (WRR), where the former captures the item preference of each user and the latter captures the word relatedness of each item. As these two explicit structures are by nature mutually dependent, we propose TPR-OPT, a simple yet effective learning criterion that additionally includes implicit structures, such as relatedness between items and relatedness between words for each user for model optimization. Such a design not only successfully describes the joint association among users, words, and text comprehensively but also naturally yields powerful representations that are suitable for a range of recommendation tasks, including user-to-item, item-to-item, and user-to-word recommendation, as well as item-to-word reconstruction. In this paper, extensive experiments have been conducted on eight recommendation datasets, the results of which demonstrate that by including textual information from item descriptions, the proposed TPR model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various recommendation tasks.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization is one of the most powerful techniques in collaborative filtering, which models the (user, item) interactions behind historical explicit or implicit feedbacks. However, plain matrix factorization may not be able to uncover the structure correlations among users and items well such as communities and taxonomies. As a response, we design a novel algorithm, i.e., hierarchical group matrix factorization (HGMF), in order to explore and model the structure correlations among users and items in a principled way. Specifically, we first define four types of correlations, including (user, item), (user, item group), (user group, item) and (user group, item group); we then extend plain matrix factorization with a hierarchical group structure; finally, we design a novel clustering algorithm to mine the hidden structure correlations. In the experiments, we study the effectiveness of our HGMF for both rating prediction and item recommendation, and find that it is better than some state-of-the-art methods on several real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Mobile notification systems have taken a major role in driving and maintaining user engagement for online platforms. They are interesting recommender systems to machine learning practitioners with more sequential and long-term feedback considerations. Most machine learning applications in notification systems are built around response-prediction models, trying to attribute both short-term impact and long-term impact to a notification decision. However, a user's experience depends on a sequence of notifications and attributing impact to a single notification is not always accurate, if not impossible. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning is a better framework for notification systems in terms of performance and iteration speed. We propose an offline reinforcement learning framework to optimize sequential notification decisions for driving user engagement. We describe a state-marginalized importance sampling policy evaluation approach, which can be used to evaluate the policy offline and tune learning hyperparameters. Through simulations that approximate the notifications ecosystem, we demonstrate the performance and benefits of the offline evaluation approach as a part of the reinforcement learning modeling approach. Finally, we collect data through online exploration in the production system, train an offline Double Deep Q-Network and launch a successful policy online. We also discuss the practical considerations and results obtained by deploying these policies for a large-scale recommendation system use-case.},

abstract = {Review-based recommender systems (RRS) have received an increasing interest since reviews greatly enhance recommendation quality and interpretability. However, existing RRS suffer from high computational complexity, biased recommendation and poor generalization. The three problems make them inadequate to handle real recommendation scenarios. Previous studies address each issue separately, while none of them consider solving three problems together under a unified framework. This paper presents LUME (a Lightweight Unbiased Multi-teacher Ensemble) for RRS. LUME is a novel framework that addresses the three problems simultaneously. LUME uses multi-teacher ensemble and debiased knowledge distillation to aggregate knowledge from multiple pretrained RRS, and generates a small, unbiased student recommender which generalizes better. Extensive experiments on various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LUME successfully tackles the three problems and has superior performance than state-of-the-art RRS and knowledge distillation based RS.},

abstract = {The overload of information on the Internet becomes ubiquitous nowadays, which makes the role of recommender systems more important. In recommender systems, the interest of users and popularity of items are not static, but can change drastically. Thus modeling the temporal dynamic of user-item interactions is crucial in recommender systems. The newly proposed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) method is able to modeling the temporal mechanism of a system with neural networks. By using the ODE-LSTM method, which unites the ability of NODE to handle continuous time and that of LSTM to address sequential data, in this paper we achieve significant improvements for the recommendation task on several real-world datasets with the time irregularity. To handle sessions with different timestamps in ODE-LSTM, we propose a collective timeline technique that contributes a lot to the performance improvement. Moreover, we find that reducing the scale of time intervals in sessions significantly improves the recommendation performance.},

abstract = {A central goal of collaborative filtering (CF) is to rank items by their utilities with respect to individual users in order to make personalized recommendations. Traditionally, this is often formulated as a rating prediction problem. However, it is more desirable for CF algorithms to address the ranking problem directly without going through an extra rating prediction step. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic latent preference analysis (pLPA) model for ranking predictions by directly modeling user preferences with respect to a set of items rather than the rating scores on individual items. From a user's observed ratings, we extract his preferences in the form of pairwise comparisons of items which are modeled by a mixture distribution based on Bradley-Terry model. An EM algorithm for fitting the corresponding latent class model as well as a method for predicting the optimal ranking are described. Experimental results on real world data sets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over several existing CF algorithms based on rating predictions in terms of ranking performance measure NDCG.},

In this work, we clarify data sparsity by bounding the solution space of MF algorithms. We present the conditions that an MF algorithm should satisfy for reliable completion of the unobservables, and we further propose to augment current MF algorithms with extra constraints constructed by compressive sampling on the unobserved values, which is well-motivated by the theoretical analysis. Model learning and optimal solution searching is conducted in a properly reduced solution space to achieve more accurate and efficient rating prediction performances. We implemented the proposed algorithms in the Map-Reduce framework, and comprehensive experimental results on Yelp and Dianping datasets verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the augmented matrix factorization algorithms.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) methods are making an impact on our daily lives in a wide range of applications, including recommender systems and personalization. Latent factor methods, e.g., matrix factorization (MF), have been the state-of-the-art in CF, however they lack interpretability and do not provide a straightforward explanation for their predictions. Explainability is gaining momentum in recommender systems for accountability, and because a good explanation can swing an undecided user. Most recent explainable recommendation methods require auxiliary data such as review text or item content on top of item ratings. In this paper, we address the case where no additional data are available and propose augmenting the classical MF framework for CF with a prior that encodes each user's embedding as a sparse linear combination of item embeddings, and vice versa for each item embedding. Our XPL-CF approach automatically reveals these user-item relationships, which underpin the latent factors and explain how the resulting recommendations are formed. We showcase the effectiveness of XPL-CF on real data from various application domains. We also evaluate the explainability of the user-item relationship obtained from XPL-CF through numeric evaluation and case study examples.},

abstract = {Deep learning-based recommendation systems have made significant strides in recent years. However, the problem of recommendation systems' generalizability has not been solved. After the training phase, most current models can only solve problems on a particular dataset and are not as generalizable as NLP and CV models. Therefore, a large amount of computing power is required to make conventional recommendation models available to different trades. In real-world scenarios, offline retailers often opt out of recommendation algorithms due to a lack of computer capacity, which puts them at a competitive disadvantage. As a result, we propose an Interaction Graph Auto-encoder Network (IGA) based on topology-aware to address the transferable recommendation problem. IGA is composed primarily of the following components: Interaction Feature Subgraph Extraction, Subgraph Node Labeling, Subgraph Interaction Auto-encoder, and Interaction Preference Attention Network. IGA can transfer knowledge from the training dataset to the new dataset without fine-tuning and give users reliable, personalized recommendation results. Experiments on the MovieLens, Douban, LastFM, and Book-Crossing datasets demonstrate that IGA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in transferable scenarios. Additionally, IGA requires fewer computing power and is highly adaptable across datasets.},

abstract = {Sequential tabular data is one of the most commonly used data types in real-world applications. Different from conventional tabular data, where rows in a table are independent, sequential tabular data contains rich contextual and sequential information, where some fields aredynamically changing over time and others arestatic. Existing transformer-based approaches analyzing sequential tabular data overlook the differences between dynamic and static fields by replicating and filling static fields into each record, and ignore temporal information between rows, which leads to three major disadvantages: (1) computational overhead, (2) artificially simplified data for masked language modeling pre-training task that may yield less meaningful representations, and (3) disregarding the temporal behavioral patterns implied by time intervals. In this work, we propose FATA-Trans, a model with two field transformers for modeling sequential tabular data, where each processes static and dynamic field information separately. FATA-Trans isfield - andtime -aware for sequential tabular data. Thefield -type embedding in the method enables FATA-Trans to capture differences between static and dynamic fields. Thetime -aware position embedding exploits both order and time interval information between rows, which helps the model detect underlying temporal behavior in a sequence. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the learned representations from FATA-Trans consistently outperform state-of-the-art solutions in the downstream tasks. We also present visualization studies to highlight the insights captured by the learned representations, enhancing our understanding of the underlying data.

Timeline summarization of an event by key sentences eases story digestion, but does not distinguish between what a user remembers and what she might want to re-check. In this work, we present a novel approach for timeline summarization of high-impact events, which uses entities instead of sentences for summarizing the event at each individual point in time. Such entity summaries can serve as both (1) important memory cues in a retrospective event consideration and (2) pointers for personalized event exploration. In order to automatically create such summaries, it is crucial to identify the "right" entities for inclusion. We propose to learn a ranking function for entities, with a dynamically adapted trade-off between the in-document salience of entities and the informativeness of entities across documents, i.e., the level of new information associated with an entity for a time point under consideration. Furthermore, for capturing collective attention for an entity we use an innovative soft labeling approach based on Wikipedia. Our experiments on a real large news datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

We then highlight recent efforts to apply continual learning to practical deployment environments, such as resource-constrained systems and sequential interaction settings.

abstract = {Brain-computer interface based on electroencephalogram (EEG) has demonstrated significant potential for capturing users' implicit preferences, offering an innovative technique for music recommendation. However, we face two key challenges: (1) ineffective distinction of complex neural patterns in EEG signals, and (2) the cold-start problem, due to limited user EEG samples. To address these issues, we present EEG-FSL, a novel framework that integrates model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) with dual-path neural feature extraction for music recommendation. EEG-FSL applies an attention-enhanced EEG encoder to extract meaningful patterns from brain signals through complementary pathways: one pathway retains temporal and phase information, while the other focuses on extracting common frequency-domain features. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to explore the intrinsic structure of the data, significantly improving the model's feature differentiation ability. Additionally, we propose a meta-learning method which allows EEG-FSL to quickly adapt to new users using only a small number of EEG samples, effectively solving cold-start problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specially, in few-shot scenarios, compared to the best baseline, our approach improves mean squared error in score prediction by 8.4% and classification accuracy by 16.8%. Consequently, our work provides a practical solution for next-generation brain-computer interface applications, capable of delivering highly personalized content recommendations while minimizing user data collection requirements.

abstract = {E-commerce retrieval and ranking optimization have expanded to incorporate broader metrics that capture user engagement and business objectives. Modern search frameworks now incorporate advanced quality features, such as sales counts and document-query relevance, to better align search results with these goals. Traditional methods typically focus on click-through rate (CTR) as a measure of engagement or relevance, but this can miss true purchase intent, creating a gap between user interest and actual conversions. Joint training with the click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) has become essential for understanding buying behavior, although its sparsity poses challenges for reliable optimization. This study presents MOHPER, a Multi-Objective HyperParameter optimization framework for E-commerce Retrieval systems. Using Bayesian optimization and sampling, it jointly optimizes CTR, CTCVR, and other relevant objectives, with a focus on user engagement and conversion. To enhance configuration selection in multi-objective optimization, we propose advanced hyperparameter selection methods, including a meta-configuration voting strategy and a cumulative training approach that leverages prior optima to improve training efficiency and performance. Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed framework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced optimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.},

abstract = {Recommending products to users means estimating their preferences for certain items over others. This can be cast either as a problem of estimating the rating that each user will give to each item, or as a problem of estimating users' relative preferences in the form of a ranking. Although collaborative-filtering approaches can be used to identify users who rate and rank products similarly, another source of data that informs us about users' preferences is their set of social connections. Both rating- and ranking-based paradigms are important in real-world recommendation settings, though rankings are especially important in settings where explicit feedback in the form of a numerical rating may not be available. Although many existing works have studied how social connections can be used to build better models for rating prediction, few have used social connections as a means to derive more accurate ranking-based models. Using social connections to better estimate users' rankings of products is the task we consider in this paper. We develop a model, SBPR (Social Bayesian Personalized Ranking), based on the simple observation that users tend to assign higher ranks to items that their friends prefer. We perform experiments on four real-world recommendation data sets, and show that SBPR outperforms alternatives in ranking prediction both in warm- and cold-start settings.},

abstract = {Providing natural language-based explanations to justify recommendations helps to improve users' satisfaction and gain users' trust. However, as current explanation generation methods are commonly trained with an objective to mimic existing user reviews, the generated explanations are often not aligned with the predicted ratings or some important features of the recommended items, and thus, are suboptimal in helping users make informed decision on the recommendation platform. To tackle this problem, we propose a flexible model-agnostic method named MMI (Maximizing Mutual Information) framework to enhance the alignment between the generated natural language explanations and the predicted rating/important item features. Specifically, we propose to use mutual information (MI) as a measure for the alignment and train a neural MI estimator. Then, we treat a well-trained explanation generation model as the backbone model and further fine-tune it through reinforcement learning with guidance from the MI estimator, which rewards a generated explanation that is more aligned with the predicted rating or a pre-defined feature of the recommended item. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our MMI framework can boost different backbone models, enabling them to outperform existing baselines in terms of alignment with predicted ratings and item features. Additionally, user studies verify that MI-enhanced explanations indeed facilitate users' decisions and are favorable compared with other baselines due to their better alignment properties.},

abstract = {In recommendation literature, explainability and fairness are becoming two prominent perspectives to consider. However, prior works have mostly addressed them separately, for instance by explaining to consumers why a certain item was recommended or mitigating disparate impacts in recommendation utility. None of them has leveraged explainability techniques to inform unfairness mitigation. In this paper, we propose an approach that relies on counterfactual explanations to augment the set of user-item interactions, such that using them while inferring recommendations leads to fairer outcomes. Modeling user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, our approach augments the latter by identifying new user-item edges that not only can explain the original unfairness by design, but can also mitigate it. Experiments on two public data sets show that our approach effectively leads to a better trade-off between fairness and recommendation utility compared with state-of-the-art mitigation procedures. We further analyze the characteristics of added edges to highlight key unfairness patterns. Source code available at https://github.com/jackmedda/RS-BGExplainer/tree/cikm2023.},

abstract = {Learning and predicting user responses, such as clicks and conversions, are crucial for many Internet-based businesses including web search, e-commerce, and online advertising. Typically, a user response model is established by optimizing the prediction accuracy, e.g., minimizing the error between the prediction and the ground truth user response. However, in many practical cases, predicting user responses is only part of a rather larger predictive or optimization task, where on one hand, the accuracy of a user response prediction determines the final (expected) utility to be optimized, but on the other hand, its learning may also be influenced from the follow-up stochastic process. It is, thus, of great interest to optimize the entire process as a whole rather than treat them independently or sequentially. In this paper, we take real-time display advertising as an example, where the predicted user's ad click-through rate (CTR) is employed to calculate a bid for an ad impression in the second price auction. We reformulate a common logistic regression CTR model by putting it back into its subsequent bidding context: rather than minimizing the prediction error, the model parameters are learned directly by optimizing campaign profit. The gradient update resulted from our formulations naturally fine-tunes the cases where the market competition is high, leading to a more cost-effective bidding. Our experiments demonstrate that, while maintaining comparable CTR prediction accuracy, our proposed user response learning leads to campaign profit gains as much as 78.2% for offline test and 25.5% for online A/B test over strong baselines.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) has been widely employed within recommender systems to solve many real-world problems. Learning effective latent factors plays the most important role in collaborative filtering. Traditional CF methods based upon matrix factorization techniques learn the latent factors from the user-item ratings and suffer from the cold start problem as well as the sparsity problem. Some improved CF methods enrich the priors on the latent factors by incorporating side information as regularization. However, the learned latent factors may not be very effective due to the sparse nature of the ratings and the side information. To tackle this problem, we learn effective latent representations via deep learning. Deep learning models have emerged as very appealing in learning effective representations in many applications. In particular, we propose a general deep architecture for CF by integrating matrix factorization with deep feature learning. We provide a natural instantiations of our architecture by combining probabilistic matrix factorization with marginalized denoising stacked auto-encoders. The combined framework leads to a parsimonious fit over the latent features as indicated by its improved performance in comparison to prior state-of-art models over four large datasets for the tasks of movie/book recommendation and response prediction.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a pivotal technique in modern recommender systems. The learning process of CF models typically consists of three components: interaction encoder, loss function, and negative sampling. Although many existing studies have proposed various CF models to design sophisticated interaction encoders, recent work shows that simply reformulating the loss functions can achieve significant performance gains. This paper delves into analyzing the relationship among existing loss functions. Our mathematical analysis reveals that the previous loss functions can be interpreted as alignment and uniformity functions: (i) the alignment matches user and item representations, and (ii) the uniformity disperses user and item distributions. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a novel loss function that improves the design of alignment and uniformity considering the unique patterns of datasets called Margin-aware Alignment and Weighted Uniformity (MAWU). The key novelty of MAWU is two-fold: (i) margin-aware alignment (MA) mitigates user/item-specific popularity biases, and (ii) weighted uniformity (WU) adjusts the significance between user and item uniformities to reflect the inherent characteristics of datasets. Extensive experimental results show that MF and LightGCN equipped with MAWU are comparable or superior to state-of-the-art CF models with various loss functions on three public datasets.},

abstract = {Sequential recommendation aims to capture user preferences by modeling sequential patterns in user-item interactions. However, these models are often influenced by noise such as accidental interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, to reduce the effect of noise, some works propose explicitly identifying and removing noisy items. However, we find that simply relying on collaborative information may result in an over-denoising problem, especially for cold items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework: Interest Alignment for Denoising Sequential Recommendation (IADSR) which integrates both collaborative and semantic information. Specifically, IADSR is comprised of two stages: in the first stage, we obtain the collaborative and semantic embeddings of each item from a traditional sequential recommendation model and an LLM, respectively. In the second stage, we align the collaborative and semantic embeddings and then identify noise in the interaction sequence based on long-term and short-term interests captured in the collaborative and semantic modalities. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its compatibility with different sequential recommendation systems. The code and data are released for reproducibility: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/IADSR.},

abstract = {Visually-aware recommender system (VARS) has become increasingly prevalent in various online services by integrating visual features of items to enhance recommendation quality. However, VARS introduces new security vulnerabilities and malicious attackers can perform visual shilling attacks to manipulate recommendation lists via uploading generated images with visually imperceptible perturbations. While prior research has explored such threats to help service providers enhance their systems, existing visual shilling attack methods still suffer from uncontrolled pixel-space perturbation, energy dispersion dilemma and semantic misalignment in reference selection. In this work, we present Semantic-Constrained Diffusion Adversarial Generation (SC-DAG) for visual shilling attacks. SC-DAG overcomes key limitations of previous methods by focusing perturbations on semantically meaningful image regions through contour-aware segmentation, guiding adversarial generation in latent space using a conditional diffusion process, and performing a hybrid reference image selection strategy that balances popularity and semantic similarity. Extensive experiments on performing visual shilling attacks against multiple VARS models show that SC-DAG achieves state-of-the-art attack performance in elevating target items' ranking, while maintaining strong perceptual indistinguishability and minimal impact on overall recommendation performance of the system. Our work offers insights into leveraging structured semantic priors for more sophisticated adversarial manipulations against VARS and also highlights the necessity for developing more robust VARS models resilient to visual shilling attacks.

abstract = {Recommender systems trained on implicit feedback data rely on negative sampling to distinguish positive items from negative items for each user. Since the majority of positive interactions come from a small group of active users, negative samplers are often impacted by data imbalance, leading them to choose more informative negatives for prominent users while providing less useful ones for users who are not so active. This leads to inactive users being further marginalised in the training process, thus receiving inferior recommendations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating that state-of-the-art negative sampling strategies provide more accurate recommendations for active users than for inactive users. We also find that increasing the number of negative samples for each positive item improves the average performance, but the benefit is distributed unequally across user groups, with active users experiencing performance gain while inactive users suffering performance degradation. To address this, we propose a group-specific negative sampling strategy that assigns smaller negative ratios to inactive user groups and larger ratios to active groups. Experiments on eight negative samplers show that our approach improves user-side fairness and performance when compared to a uniform global ratio.},

abstract = {Nowadays, modern recommender systems usually leverage textual and visual contents as auxiliary information to predict user preference. For textual information, review texts are one of the most popular contents to model user behaviors. Nevertheless, reviews usually lose their shine when it comes to top-N recommender systems because those that solely utilize textual reviews as features struggle to adequately capture the interaction relationships between users and items. For visual one, it is usually modeled with naive convolutional networks and also hard to capture high-order relationships between users and items. Moreover, previous works did not collaboratively use both texts and images in a proper way. In this paper, we propose printf, preference modeling based on user reviews with item images and textual information via graph learning, to address the above challenges. Specifically, the dimension-based attention mechanism directs relations between user reviews and interacted items, allowing each dimension to contribute different importance weights to derive user representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed printf consistently outperforms baseline methods with the relative improvements for NDCG@5 of 26.80%, 48.65%, and 25.74% on Amazon-Grocery, Amazon-Tools, and Amazon-Electronics datasets, respectively. The in-depth analysis also indicates the dimensions of review representations definitely have different topics and aspects, assisting the validity of our model design.},

abstract = {Fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims to identify sentiments associated with specific aspects within sentences, faces challenges in effectively incorporating commonsense knowledge. Recent advancements leveraging large language models (LLMs) as data generators show promise but are limited by the LLMs' lack of nuanced, domain-specific understanding and pose a significant risk of data leakage during inference, potentially leading to inflated performance metrics. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Kit, a novel framework for commonsense-enhanced fine-grained sentiment analysis that integrates knowledge via LLM-guided graph construction, effectively mitigating data leakage risks. LLM-Kit operates in two key stages: (1) Commonsense Graph Construction (CGC): We design second-order rules and leverage LLMs for evaluation to ensure the accuracy of the generated graph and mitigate the risk of data leakage from LLMs. (2) Knowledge-integration Graph Representation Learning (KGRL): We extract knowledge that is aware of various aspects through Graph Representation Learning (GRL). To capture the underlying semantic nuances within the input sentence, we develop a Sentence Semantic Learning (SSL) module based on RoBERTa that explicitly encodes internal semantics. This module provides complementary information to the GCN, improving the model's ability to discern subtle sentiment variations related to different aspects. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets affirm that LLM-Kit achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art models.},

Many existing studies have attempted to advance the performance of collaborative filtering methods by leveraging the user-user matrix to enhance user embedding learning with user's social connections. While the existing social recommender systems have demonstrated good performance in various recommendation tasks, the extent of social information usefulness in recommender systems remains unclear. This paper addresses the research gap by designing experiments to answer three research questions: (i) How useful is social information in varying user-item data sparsity? (ii) How much social information do the existing social recommendation models use? (iii) How valuable is social information for cold-start situations? Working towards answering the research questions, we introduce evaluation metrics to estimate the utilization of social information in the existing social recommendation models. We conducted experiments on three publicly available social recommendation datasets, and our results showed that there are diminishing returns when applying social information in recommender systems.},

abstract = {Social media popularity forecasting has become a hot research topic in recent years. It is of great significance in assisting public opinion monitoring and advertising placement. Time series prediction is one of the simple and commonly used methods for popularity forecasting, which takes the popularity of the first few time steps in the observed data as inputs. However, the complete popularity trend of each social media is known in the training dataset, while the historical time series information except for the first few time steps is neglected in the existing models. In order to utilize the complete historical information from the observed data, a retrieval method is introduced in this paper. Therefore, how to retrieve similar social media based on the first few steps time series and how to integrate the similar historical information have become two challenges. A two-stage prediction method named Angle Feature Retrieval based Forecasting (AFRF) is proposed in this paper to solve the upper two problems. In the first stage, based on the angle features of series, we retrieve K similar series from the historical posts and concatenate them with the target series as the model's input. In the second stage, an attention mechanism is used to learn the temporal relationships among the series and generate future popularity forecasts. We evaluated the multi-step and single-point forecasting performance of AFRF on three real-world datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art popularity forecasting methods, such as temporal feature-based and cascade-based methods, verifying the effectiveness of AFRF.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art item recommendation algorithms, which apply Factorization Machines (FM) as a scoring function and pairwise ranking loss as a trainer (PRFM for short), have been recently investigated for the implicit feedback based context-aware recommendation problem (IFCAR). However, good recommenders particularly emphasize on the accuracy near the top of the ranked list, and typical pairwise loss functions might not match well with such a requirement. In this paper, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, PRFM models usually lead to non-optimal item recommendation results due to such a mismatch. Inspired by the success of LambdaRank, we introduce Lambda Factorization Machines (LambdaFM), which is particularly intended for optimizing ranking performance for IFCAR. We also point out that the original lambda function suffers from the issue of expensive computational complexity in such settings due to a large amount of unobserved feedback. Hence, instead of directly adopting the original lambda strategy, we create three effective lambda surrogates by conducting a theoretical analysis for lambda from the top-N optimization perspective. Further, we prove that the proposed lambda surrogates are generic and applicable to a large set of pairwise ranking loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate LambdaFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on three real-world datasets in terms of four standard ranking measures.},

abstract = {Reviews are valuable resources that have been widely researched and used to improve the quality of recommendation services. Recent methods use multiple full embedding layers to model various levels of individual preferences, increasing the risk of the data sparsity issue. Although it is a potential way to deal with this issue that models homophily among users who have similar behaviors, the existing approaches are implemented in a coarse-grained way. They calculate user similarities by considering the homophily in their global behaviors but ignore their local behaviors under a specific context. In this paper, we propose a two-tier shared embedding model (TSE), which fuses coarse- and fine-grained ways of modeling homophily. It considers global behaviors to model homophily in a coarse-grained way, and the high-level feature in the process of each user-item interaction to model homophily in a fine-grained way. TSE designs a whole-to-part principle-based process to fuse these ways in the review-based recommendation. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that TSE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. It outperforms the best baseline by 20.50% on the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 23.96% on the mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

abstract = {Sequential recommendation has been receiving increasing attention from researchers. Existing sequential recommendation models leverage deep learning models to capture sequential features. However, these methods ignore confounders in the recommendation process, which can lead the model to learn incorrect correlations and fail to accurately capture users' true preferences. Moreover, these methods rely on extensive interaction sequences, but sequential data often suffers from sparsity issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a &lt;u&gt; P &lt;/u&gt;reference-&lt;u&gt; a &lt;/u&gt;ware &lt;u&gt; C &lt;/u&gt;ausal &lt;u&gt; I &lt;/u&gt;ntervention and Counter&lt;u&gt; f &lt;/u&gt;a&lt;u&gt; c &lt;/u&gt;tual Data Augmentation ( Pacific ) framework to enhance sequential recommendation. Initially, we model the causal graph of sequential recommendation and categorize user preferences into global long-term preferences, local long-term preferences, and short-term preferences. Then, we introduce the front-door criterion to eliminate the interference of confounders and design different self-attention mechanisms to estimate the causal effects, aiming to capture users' true preferences. In addition, based on counterfactual thinking, we design a counterfactual data augmentation module to generate enriched sequences. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.},

abstract = {Large quantifies of online user activity data, such as weekly web search volumes, which co-evolve with the mutual influence of several queries and locations, serve as an important social sensor. It is an important task to accurately forecast the future activity by discovering latent interactions from such data, i.e., the ecosystems between each query and the flow of influences between each area. However, this is a difficult problem in terms of data quantity and complex patterns covering the dynamics. To tackle the problem, we propose FluxCube, which is an effective mining method that forecasts large collections of co-evolving online user activity and provides good interpretability. Our model is the expansion of a combination of two mathematical models: a reaction-diffusion system provides a framework for modeling the flow of influences between local area groups and an ecological system models the latent interactions between each query. Also, by leveraging the concept of physics-informed neural networks, FluxCube achieves high interpretability obtained from the parameters and high forecasting performance, together. Extensive experiments on real datasets showed that FluxCube outperforms comparable models in terms of the forecasting accuracy, and each component in FluxCube contributes to the enhanced performance. We then show some case studies that FluxCube can extract useful latent interactions between queries and area groups.},

abstract = {Micro-form videos have emerged as a popular form of content, leading to extensive research in micro-video recommendation with significant implications for the entertainment, advertising, and e-commerce industries. However, the lack of publicly available large-scale micro-video datasets presents a challenge for developing effective recommender systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive and diverse micro-video recommendation dataset, referred to as ''MicroLens.'' This dataset comprises nine million user-item interaction behaviors, one million users, and 91 thousand full-length micro-videos. It includes rich modality information such as titles, cover images, and audio associated with the videos. MicroLens serves as a benchmark for the content-driven micro-video recommendation, allowing researchers to leverage diverse video modality information, particularly the raw video features, to enhance the effectiveness of recommender systems. This goes beyond the traditional reliance on item IDs or off-the-shelf pre-extracted video/visual features, providing new avenues for improving recommendation accuracy and personalization. We have conducted extensive experiments on MicroLens, benchmarking multiple recommender models and video encoders, which have provided valuable insights into the performance of micro-video recommendation. We anticipate that this dataset will not only benefit the recommender system community but also foster advancements in the field of video understanding.

abstract = {Sequential recommenders have made great strides in capturing a user's preferences. Nevertheless, the cold-start recommendation remains a fundamental challenge as they typically involve limited user-item interactions for personalization. Recently, gradient-based meta-learning approaches have emerged in the sequential recommendation field due to their fast adaptation and easy-to-integrate abilities. The meta-learning algorithms formulate the cold-start recommendation as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is represented as a task to be adapted. While meta-learning algorithms generally assume that task-wise samples are evenly distributed over classes or values, user-item interactions in real-world applications do not conform to such a distribution (e.g., watching favorite videos multiple times, leaving only positive ratings without any negative ones). Consequently, imbalanced user feedback, which accounts for the majority of task training data, may dominate the user adaptation process and prevent meta-learning algorithms from learning meaningful meta-knowledge for personalized recommendations. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel sequential recommendation framework based on gradient-based meta-learning that captures the imbalanced rating distribution of each user and computes adaptive loss for user-specific learning. Our work is the first to tackle the impact of imbalanced ratings in cold-start sequential recommendation scenarios. Through extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

abstract = {Customers are increasingly using online channels to buy products. For e-commerce companies, this offers new opportunities to tailor the shopping experience to customers' needs. Therefore, it is of great importance for a company to know their customers' intentions while browsing their webpage. A major challenge is the real-time analysis of a customer's intention during browsing sessions. To this end, a representation of the customer's browsing behavior must be retrieved from their live interactions on the webpage. Typically, characteristic behavioral features are extracted manually based on the knowledge of marketing experts. In this paper, we propose a customer embedding representation that is based on the customer's click-events recorded during browsing sessions. Thus, our approach does not use manually extracted features and is not based on marketing expert domain knowledge, which makes it transferable to different webpages and different online markets. We demonstrate our approach using three different e-commerce datasets to successfully predict whether a customer is going to purchase a specific product. For the prediction, we utilize the customer embedding representations as input for different machine learning models. We compare our approach with existing state-of-the-art approaches for real-time purchase prediction and show that our proposed customer representation with an LSTM predictor outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on all three datasets. Additionally, the creation process of our customers' representation is on average 235 times faster than the creation process of the baseline.},

abstract = {Most existing collaborative filtering techniques have focused on modeling the binary relation of users to items by extracting from user ratings. Aside from users' ratings, their affiliated reviews often provide the rationale for their ratings and identify what aspects of the item they cared most about. We explore the rich evidence source of aspects in user reviews to improve top-N recommendation. By extracting aspects (i.e., the specific properties of items) from textual reviews, we enrich the user--item binary relation to a user--item--aspect ternary relation. We model the ternary relation as a heterogeneous tripartite graph, casting the recommendation task as one of vertex ranking. We devise a generic algorithm for ranking on tripartite graphs -- TriRank -- and specialize it for personalized recommendation. Experiments on two public review datasets show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, TriRank endows the recommender system with a higher degree of explainability and transparency by modeling aspects in reviews. It allows users to interact with the system through their aspect preferences, assisting users in making informed decisions.},

Prior research primarily focused on combining user social graphs and information cascades for prediction, often overlooking the distinct role characteristics users exhibit during interactions. Classifying users into different roles enables the construction of a multi-layered social graph, facilitating the extraction of deeper user features. This paper introduces a model that leverages multi-dimensional interactions between user features. Specifically, to account for users' dynamic preferences, we construct sequential hypergraphs from information cascades using timestamps and utilize a hypergraph neural network to extract users' dynamic features. Furthermore, to capture users' static features, we build multi-layer social networks from the social graph based on users' roles. We employ graph convolutional networks to separately extract static features from each layer and subsequently fuse them using an attention mechanism. Superior performance of our framework is evidenced by experimental validation on real-world datasets against cutting-edge benchmarks.},

This issue becomes even more severe for neighborhood-based collaborative filtering methods, as there are even lower numbers of ratings available in the neighborhood of the query item. In this paper, we aim to address the Data Sparsity issue in the context of the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering. Given the (user, item) query, a set of key ratings are identified, and an auto-adaptive imputation method is proposed to fill the missing values in the set of key ratings. The proposed method can be used with any similarity metrics, such as the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Cosine-based similarity, and it is theoretically guaranteed to outperform the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering approaches. Results from experiments prove that the proposed method could significantly improve the accuracy of recommendations for neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering algorithms.},

This study introduces innovative approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed textual descriptions that enhance both user and item representations.

These methods promise a deeper, more nuanced understanding of both users and items, potentially leading to superior recommendation accuracy.

abstract = {The recent popularity of edge devices and Artificial Intelligent of Things (AIoT) has driven a new wave of contextual recommendations, such as location based Point of Interest (PoI) recommendations and computing resource-aware mobile app recommendations. In many such recommendation scenarios, contexts are drifting over time. For example, in a mobile game recommendation, contextual features like locations, battery, and storage levels of mobile devices are frequently drifting over time. However, most existing graph-based collaborative filtering methods are designed under the assumption of static features. Therefore, they would require frequent retraining and/or yield graphical models burgeoning in sizes, impeding their suitability for context-drifting recommendations.In this work, we propose a specifically tailor-made Hybrid Static and Adaptive Graph Embedding (HySAGE) network for context-drifting recommendations. Our key idea is to disentangle the relatively static user-item interaction and rapidly drifting contextual features. Specifically, our proposed HySAGE network learns a relatively static graph embedding from user-item interaction and an adaptive embedding from drifting contextual features. These embeddings are incorporated into an interest network to generate the user interest in some certain context. We adopt an interactive attention module to learn the interactions among static graph embeddings, adaptive contextual embeddings, and user interest, helping to achieve a better final representation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HySAGE significantly improves the performance of the existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {To provide promising recommendation results, there exist three major stages in the industrial RecSys chain to support our service: (1) The first Retrieval model aims at searching hundreds of item candidates. (2) Next, the Ranking model estimates the multiple aspect probabilities Pxtrs for each retrieved item. (3) At last, the Ensemble Sort stage merges those Pxtrs into one comparable score, and then selects the best dozen items with the highest scores to recommend them. To our knowledge, the wide-accepted industry ensemble sort approach still relies on manual formula-based adjustment, i.e., assigning manual weights for Pxtrs to control its influence on fusion score. Under this framework, the RecSys severely relies on expert knowledge to determine satisfactory weight for each Pxtr, which blocks RecSys's further advancements. In this paper, we provide Pantheon, a practical neural-network based ensemble sort. Compared with formulation-based ensemble sort, our Pantheon has the following advantages: (1) Personalized Joint Training: our Pantheon is jointly trained with the real-time ranking model, which could capture ever-changing user personalized interests accurately. (2) Representation inheritance: instead of the highly compressed Pxtrs, our Pantheon utilizes the fine-grained hidden-states as model input, which could benefit from the Ranking model to enhance our model complexity. Meanwhile, to reach a balanced multi-objective ensemble sort, we further devise an iterative Pareto policy optimization (IPPO) strategy to consider the multiple objectives at the same time. To our knowledge, this paper is the first work to replace the entire formulation-based ensemble sort in industry RecSys, which was fully deployed at Kuaishou live-streaming services, serving 400 Million users daily.},

abstract = {Although a variety of methods have been proposed for sequential recommendation, it is still far from being well solved partly due to two challenges. First, the existing methods often lack the simultaneous consideration of the global stability and local fluctuation of user preference, which might degrade the learning of a user's current preference. Second, the existing methods often use a scalar based weighting schema to fuse the long-term and short-term preferences, which is too coarse to learn an expressive embedding of current preference. To address the two challenges, we propose a novel model called Time Lag aware Sequential Recommendation (TLSRec), which integrates a hierarchical modeling of user preference and a time lag sensitive fine-grained fusion of the long-term and short-term preferences. TLSRec employs a hierarchical self-attention network to learn users' preference at both global and local time scales, and a neural time gate to adaptively regulate the contributions of the long-term and short-term preferences for the learning of a user's current preference at the aspect level and based on the lag between the current time and the time of the last behavior of a user. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the effectiveness of TLSRec.},

abstract = {Implicit feedback is frequently used for developing personalized recommendation services due to its ubiquity and accessibility in real-world systems. In order to effectively utilize such information, most research adopts the pairwise ranking method on constructed training triplets (user, positive item, negative item) and aims to distinguish between positive items and negative items for each user. However, most of these methods treat all the training triplets equally, which ignores the subtle difference between different positive or negative items. On the other hand, even though some other works make use of the auxiliary information (e.g., dwell time) of user behaviors to capture this subtle difference, such auxiliary information is hard to obtain. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel training framework named Triplet Importance Learning (TIL), which adaptively learns the importance score of training triplets. We devise two strategies for the importance score generation and formulate the whole procedure as a bilevel optimization, which does not require any rule-based design. We integrate the proposed training procedure with several Matrix Factorization (MF)- and Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based recommendation models, demonstrating the compatibility of our framework. Via a comparison using three real-world datasets with many state-of-the-art methods, we show that our proposed method outperforms the best existing models by 3-21% in terms of Recall@k for the top-k recommendation.},

abstract = {Multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world applications. However, MTL models often suffer from performance degradation with negative transfer due to sharing all features without distinguishing their helpfulness for all tasks. To this end, many works on feature selection for multi-task learning (FS-MTL) have been proposed to alleviate negative transfer between tasks by learning features selectively for each specific task. However, due to latent confounders between features and task targets, the correlations captured by the feature selection modules proposed in these works may fail to reflect the actual effect of the features on the targets. This paper explains negative transfer in FS-MTL from a causal perspective and presents a novel architecture called Causal Feature Selection for Multi-task Learning(CFS-MTL). This method incorporates the idea of causal inference into feature selection for multi-task learning via pseudo-intervention. It aims to select features with more stable causal effects rather than spurious correlations for each task by regularizing the distance between feature ITEs and feature importance. We conduct extensive experiments based on three real-world datasets to demonstrate that our proposed CFS-MTL outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models significantly in the AUC metric.},

When the set of recommendable items is large, training and evaluation of item recommendation models becomes computationally expensive. To lower this cost, it has become common to sample negative items. However, the recommendation quality can suffer from biases introduced by traditional negative sampling mechanisms.In this work, we demonstrate the benefits from correcting the bias introduced by sampling of negatives. We first provide sampled batch version of the well-studied WARP and LambdaRank methods. Then, we present how these methods can benefit from improved ranking estimates. Finally, we evaluate the recommendation quality as a result of correcting rank estimates and demonstrate that WARP and LambdaRank can be learned efficiently with negative sampling and our proposed correction technique.},

abstract = {Personalized review summarization is a challenging task in recommender systems, which aims to generate condensed and readable summaries for product reviews. Recently, some methods propose to adopt the sentiment signals of reviews to enhance the review summarization. However, most previous works only share the semantic features of reviews via preliminary multi-task learning, while ignoring the rich personalized information of users and products, which is crucial to both sentiment identification and comprehensive review summarization. In this paper, we propose a sentiment-aware review summarization method with an elaborately designed multi-task fine-tuning framework to make full use of personalized information of users and products effectively based on Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). We first denote two types of personalized information including IDs and historical summaries to indicate their identification and semantics information respectively. Subsequently, we propose to incorporate the IDs of the user/product into the PLMs-based encoder to learn the personalized representations of input reviews and their historical summaries in a fine-tuning way. Based on this, an auxiliary context-aware review sentiment classification task and a further sentiment-guided personalized review summarization task are jointly learned. Specifically, the sentiment representation of input review is used to identify relevant historical summaries, which are then treated as additional semantic context features to enhance the summary generation process. Extensive experimental results show our approach could generate sentiment-consistent summaries and outperforms many competitive baselines on both review summarization and sentiment classification tasks.},

abstract = {Semantic IDs are discrete identifiers generated by quantizing the Multi-modal Large Language Models embeddings, enabling efficient multi-modal content integration in recommendation systems. However, their lack of collaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative and generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced various alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage framework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable information loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive alignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information maximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method that simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic integrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically associated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient alignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the following two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative Alignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and collaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and then design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item (u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual quantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads achieve stronger alignment. Finally, offline experiments and online A/B tests confirm DAS's efficacy, now serving 400M+ users in Kuaishou's ad platform.},

abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in recommender systems by representing users and items based on their historical interactions. However, little attention was paid to GNN's vulnerability to exposure bias: users are exposed to a limited number of items so that a system only learns a biased view of user preference to result in suboptimal recommendation quality. Although inverse propensity weighting is known to recognize and alleviate exposure bias, it usually works on the final objective with the model outputs, whereas GNN can also be biased during neighbor aggregation. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective approach, neighbor aggregation via inverse propensity (NAVIP) for GNNs. Specifically, given a user-item bipartite graph, we first derive propensity score of each user-item interaction in the graph. Then, inverse of the propensity score with Laplacian normalization is applied to debias neighbor aggregation from exposure bias. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through our extensive experiments on two public and Amazon Alexa datasets where the performance enhances up to 14.2%.},

abstract = {Modeling and predicting the popularity dynamics of individual user generated items on online social networks has important implications in a wide range of areas. The challenge of this problem comes from the inequality of the popularity of content and the numerous complex factors. Existing works mainly focus on exploring relevant factors for prediction and fitting the time series of popularity dynamics into certain class of functions, while ignoring the underlying arrival process of attentions. Also, the exogenous effect of user activity variation on the platform has been neglected. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model using an influence-based self-excited Hawkes process (ISEHP) to characterize the process through which individual microblogs gain their popularity. This model explicitly captures three ingredients: the intrinsic attractiveness of a microblog with exponential time decay, the user-specific triggering effect of each forwardings based on the endogenous influence among users, and the exogenous effect from the platform. We validate the ISEHP model by applying it on Sina Weibo, the most popular microblogging network in China. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms existing prediction models.},

abstract = {Biases and de-biasing in recommender systems have received increasing attention recently. This study focuses on a newly identified bias, i.e., sentiment bias, which is defined as the divergence in recommendation performance between positive users/items and negative users/items. Existing methods typically employ a regularization strategy to eliminate the bias. However, blindly fitting the data without modifying the training procedure would result in a biased model, sacrificing recommendation performance.In this study, we resolve the sentiment bias with causal reasoning. We develop a causal graph to model the cause-effect relationships in recommender systems, in which the sentiment polarity presented by review text acts as a confounder between user/item representations and observed ratings. The existence of confounders inspires us to go beyond conditional probability and embrace causal inference. To that aim, we use causal intervention in model training to remove the negative effect of sentiment bias. Furthermore, during model inference, we adjust the prediction score to produce personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets validate that the deconfounded training can remove the sentiment bias and the inference adjustment is helpful to improve recommendation accuracy.},

To address this, we introduce SarRec : Statistically-guaranteed Augmented Retrieval for Recommendations, a framework that uses a simple retrieval step to provide relevant context and delivers calibrated, uncertainty-aware predictions with formal statistical guarantees. Specifically, SarRec first constructs the user's context set, utilizing a lightweight differentiable retrieval mechanism for identifying relevant context, and then calibrates the LLM's outputs by adapting the conformal prediction mechanism. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an upper bound on the expected risk of recommendation performance metrics. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets from different domains validate the effectiveness of our framework.},

RECE significantly reduces memory consumption while allowing one to enjoy the state-of-the-art performance of full CE loss. Experimental results on various datasets show that RECE cuts training peak memory usage by up to 12 times compared to existing methods while retaining or exceeding performance metrics of CE loss.

Meanwhile, explanations of the recommendations further help users to better understand the recommended items so as to make informed choices, which gives rise to the importance of explainable recommendation research. Textual sentence-based explanation has been an important form of explanations for recommender systems due to its advantage in communicating rich information to users. However, current approaches to generating sentence explanations are either limited to predefined sentence templates, which restricts the sentence expressiveness, or opt for free-style sentence generation, which makes it difficult for sentence quality control. In an attempt to benefit both sentence expressiveness and quality, we propose a Neural Template (NETE) explanation generation framework, which brings the best of both worlds by learning sentence templates from data and generating template-controlled sentences that comment about specific features. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that NETE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art explanation generation approaches in terms of sentence quality and expressiveness. Further analysis on case study also shows the advantages of NETE on generating diverse and controllable explanations.},

Our model (named SER) uses three text analysis modules, guided by a single domain discriminator for disentangled representation learning. Here, we suggest a novel optimization strategy that can enhance the quality of domain disentanglement, and also debilitates detrimental information of a source domain. Also, we extend the encoding network from a single to multiple domains, which has proven to be powerful for review-based recommender systems.

Understanding and predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of CDSs are beneficial to mobile users, Internet Content Providers and carriers. Conventional methods for predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of CDSs are mostly base-stations (BSs) centric, leading to weak generalization and spatio coarse-grained. To improve the spatio accuracy and generalization of modeling, we propose user-centric methods for CDSs spatio-temporal analysis. With geocoding and spatio-temporal graphs modeling algorithms, CDSs records collected from mobile devices are modeled as dynamic graphs with spatio-temporal attributes. Moreover, we propose a spatio-temporal-social multi-feature extraction framework for spatio fine-grained CDSs hot spots prediction. Specifically, an edge-enhanced graph convolutional block is designed to encode CDSs information based on the social relations and the spatio dependence features. Besides, we introduce the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to further capture the temporal dependence. Experiments on two real-world CDSs datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and ablation studies are taken to evaluate the importance of each feature.},

To cope with continuous data growth and improve real-time recommendation performance, we have designed and implemented a high-performance batch query architecture for real-time recommendation systems. Our contributions include optimizing hash structures with a cacheline-aware probing method to enhance coalesced hashing, as well as the implementation of a hybrid storage key-value service built upon it. Our experiments indicate this approach significantly surpasses conventional hash tables in batch query throughput, achieving up to 90% of the query throughput of random memory access when incorporating parallel optimization. The support for NVMe, integrating two-tier storage for hot and cold data, notably reduces resource consumption. Additionally, the system facilitates dynamic updates, automated sharding of attributes and feature embedding tables, and introduces innovative protocols for consistency in batch queries, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of real-time incremental learning updates. This architecture has been deployed and in use in the bilibili recommendation system for over a year, a video content community with hundreds of millions of users, supporting 10x increase in model computation with minimal resource growth, improving outcomes while preserving the system's real-time performance.},

abstract = {Personalized recommendation systems often drive users towards more extreme content, exacerbating opinion polarization. While content-aware moderation has been proposed to mitigate these effects, such approaches risk curtailing the freedom of speech and information. To address this concern, we propose and explore the feasibility of content-agnostic moderation as an alternative approach for reducing polarization. Content-agnostic moderation does not rely on the actual content being moderated, arguably making it less prone to forms of censorship. We establish theoretically that content-agnostic moderation cannot be guaranteed to work in a fully generic setting. However, we show that it can often be effectively achieved in practice with plausible assumptions. We introduce two novel content-agnostic moderation methods that modify recommendations from the content recommender to disperse user-item co-clusters without relying on content features. To evaluate the potential of content-agnostic moderation in controlled experiments, we built a simulation environment to analyze the closed-loop behavior of a system with a given set of users, a recommendation system, and a moderation approach. Through comprehensive experiments in this environment, we show that our proposed moderation methods significantly enhance stance neutrality and maintain high recommendation quality across various data scenarios. Our results indicate that achieving stance neutrality without direct content information is not only feasible but can also help develop more balanced and informative recommendation systems without substantially degrading user engagement.},

In this paper, we present LangPTune, the first end-to-end training framework designed to directly optimize LLM-generated user profiles for recommendation tasks. By explicitly training the LLM for the recommendation objective, our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines. Evaluations across training setups and benchmarks show that LangPTune not only exceeds the performance of zero-shot methods but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art embedding-based baselines. Additionally, we assess whether our training framework maintains the interpretability of user profiles, using both GPT-4 simulations and crowdworker studies.},

abstract = {Recently, pretrained large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in recommendation systems to leverage their textual understanding and reasoning abilities to model user behaviors and suggest future items. A key challenge in this setting is that items on most platforms are not included in the LLM's training data. Therefore, existing methods often fine-tune LLMs by introducing auxiliary item tokens to capture item semantics. However, in real-world applications such as e-commerce and short video platforms, the item space evolves rapidly, which gives rise to a cold-start setting, where many newly introduced items receive little or even no user engagement. This poses challenges in both learning accurate item token embeddings and generalizing efficiently to accommodate the continual influx of new items. In this work, we propose a novel meta-item token learning strategy to address both these challenges simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce MI4Rec, an LLM-based approach for recommendation that uses just a few learnable meta-item tokens and an LLM encoder to dynamically aggregate meta-items based on item content. We show that this paradigm allows highly efficient and accurate learning in such challenging settings. Extensive experiments on Yelp and Amazon reviews datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MI4Rec in both warm-start and cold-start recommendations. Notably, MI4Rec achieves an average performance improvement of 20.4% in Recall and NDCG compared to the best-performing baselines. The implementation of MI4Rec is available at https://github.com/zhengzaiyi/MI4Rec},

abstract = {Graph-based Recommendation Systems (GRSs) have gained prominence for their ability to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of recommender systems by exploiting structural relationships in user-item interaction data. Despite their advanced capabilities, we find GRSs are susceptible to feedback-loop phenomena that disproportionately diminish the visibility of new and long-tail items, leading to a homogenization of recommendations and the potential emergence of echo chambers. To mitigate this feedback-loop issue, exploration and exploitation (E&amp;E) strategies have been extensively researched. However, conventional E&amp;E methods rest on the assumption that recommendations are independent and identically distributed-an assumption that is not valid for GRSs. To forge an effective E&amp;E approach tailored to GRSs, we introduce a novel framework, the &lt;u&gt;GRAD&lt;/u&gt;ient-informed &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;xploration and Exploitation (GRADE), designed to adaptively seek out underrepresented or new items with promising rewards. Our method evaluates the potential benefit of exploring an item by assessing the change in the system's empirical risk error pre- and post-exposure. For practical implementation, we approximate this measure using the gradients of potential edges and model parameters, alongside their associated uncertainties. We then orchestrate the balance between exploration and exploitation utilizing Thompson sampling and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy. Empirical tests on datasets from two industrial environments demonstrate that GRADE consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our approach has been successfully integrated into actual industrial systems.},

abstract = {Modern recommender systems face critical challenges in handling information overload while addressing the inherent limitations of multimodal representation learning. Existing methods suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1) restricted ability to represent rich multimodal features through a single representation, (2) existing linear modality fusion strategies ignore the deep nonlinear correlations between modalities, and (3) static optimization methods failing to dynamically mitigate the over-smoothing problem in graph convolutional network (GCN). To overcome these limitations, we propose HPMRec, a novel Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation framework, which utilizes hypercomplex embeddings in the form of multi-components to enhance the representation diversity of multimodal features. HPMRec adopts the hypercomplex multiplication to naturally establish nonlinear cross-modality interactions to bridge semantic gaps, which is beneficial to explore the cross-modality features. HPMRec also introduces the prompt-aware compensation mechanism to aid the misalignment between components and modality-specific features loss, and this mechanism fundamentally alleviates the over-smoothing problem. It further designs self-supervised learning tasks that enhance representation diversity and align different modalities. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that HPMRec achieves state-of-the-art recommendation performance.},

abstract = {The cold-start problem remains a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for addressing cold-start scenarios through data augmentation. However, existing cold-start augmentation methods often suffer from negative augmentation, manifesting as incomplete augmentation, where generated interactions fail to comprehensively reflect user preferences, and inaccurate augmentation, where they conflict with user intent. These issues largely stem from two limitations: (1) the inability to effectively incorporate collaborative signals, which are critical for preference alignment, and (2) the lack of awareness of the downstream model's learning dynamics during data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, the latter has not been studied in the literature.Consequently, we propose a novel framework named PAnDA. To address the incomplete augmentation issue, we propose a model-agnostic preference-aligned augmentation module to iteratively extract and fuse textual information and collaborative information by user-user preference matching and user-item preference coherence, which together form a contextual cue to guide the augmentor to generate high-quality augmented data. To overcome the inaccurate augmentation issue, we propose a model-specific downstream-model-aware adaptation module to adaptively align the augmented data with the model's states during the training process, guided by gradient similarity. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAnDA outperforms different groups of state-of-the-art cold-start recommendation methods in all scenarios.

abstract = {The incompleteness of positive labels and the presence of many unlabelled instances are common problems in binary classification applications such as in review helpfulness classification. Various studies from the classification literature consider all unlabelled instances as negative examples. However, a classification model that learns to classify binary instances with incomplete positive labels while assuming all unlabelled data to be negative examples will often generate a biased classifier. In this work, we propose a novel Negative Confidence-aware Weakly Supervised approach (NCWS), which customises a binary classification loss function by discriminating the unlabelled examples with different negative confidences during the classifier's training. NCWS allows to effectively, unbiasedly identify and separate positive and negative instances after its integration into various binary classifiers from the literature, including SVM, CNN and BERT-based classifiers. We use the review helpfulness classification as a test case for examining the effectiveness of our NCWS approach. We thoroughly evaluate NCWS by using three different datasets, namely one from Yelp (venue reviews), and two from Amazon (Kindle and Electronics reviews). Our results show that NCWS outperforms strong baselines from the literature including an existing SVM-based approach (i.e. SVM-P), the positive and unlabelled learning-based approach (i.e. C-PU) and the positive confidence-based approach (i.e. P-conf) in addressing the classifier's bias problem. Moreover, we further examine the effectiveness of NCWS by using its classified helpful reviews in a state-of-the-art review-based venue recommendation model (i.e. DeepCoNN) and demonstrate the benefits of using NCWS in enhancing venue recommendation effectiveness in comparison to the baselines.},

Specifically, we extract thedynamic fashion features highlighted by these bloggers via a BiLSTM that integrates a large corpus of visual posts and community influence. We then learn theimplicit visual influence funnel from bloggers to individual users via a personalized attention layer. Finally, we incorporate user personal style and her preferred fashion features across time in a recurrent recommendation network for dynamic fashion-updated clothing recommendation. Experiments show that FIRN outperforms state-of-the-art fashion recommenders, especially for users who are most impacted by fashion influencers, and utilizing fashion bloggers can bring greater improvements in recommendation compared with using other potential sources of visual information.

abstract = {Achieving fairness among different individuals or groups is an essential task for industrial recommender systems. Due to the group's personalized selection tendencies and the non-uniform population distributions, existing industrial recommenders tend to make unfair predictions towards the preferences of minority groups. To alleviate this unfairness, we propose a model-agnostic self-adaptive fairness constraint framework (SaFair) based on the posterior preferences of different groups. We construct group-level and individual-level fairness constraints. The former measures consistency between group-level posterior preferences and predicted interests, and the latter relies on the degree of consistency in interests between a user and their associated group to perform self-adaptive constraints. In particular, to balance effectiveness and fairness, we utilize uncertainty estimation to adjust the intensity of constraints according to the model's learning status called self-adaptive constraints. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B Testing are conducted and the results validate the superiority of our proposed method over the baselines. SaFair has been successfully deployed in Kuaishou, one of China's most popular short-video streaming platforms with hundreds of millions of active users.},

First session of this tutorial introduces multi-stakeholder recommender systems (MSRS) with several case studies, and discusses the corresponding methods and challenges in MSRS. Reviews in an e-commerce platform may be mined to address cold-start problem and to generate explanations. Our earlier tutorial covered aspect-based sentiment analysis of products and topic models/distributed representations that bridge vocabulary gap between user reviews and product descriptions. Focus in the second session of this tutorial instead is on recent neural methods for review text mining - covering hands-on code for its use to enhance product recommendation.

abstract = {Text-based collaborative filtering (TCF) has emerged as the prominent technique for text and news recommendation, employing language models (LMs) as text encoders to represent items. However, the current landscape of TCF models mainly relies on the utilization of relatively small or medium-sized LMs. The potential impact of using larger, more powerful language models (such as these with over 100 billion parameters) as item encoders on recommendation performance remains uncertain. Can we anticipate unprecedented results and discover new insights?To address this question, we undertake a comprehensive series of experiments aimed at exploring the performance limits of the TCF paradigm. Specifically, we progressively augment the scale of item encoders, ranging from one hundred million to one hundred billion parameters, in order to reveal the scaling limits of the TCF paradigm. Moreover, we investigate whether these exceptionally large LMs have the potential to establish a universal item representation for the recommendation task, thereby revolutionizing the traditional ID paradigm, which is considered a significant obstacle to developing transferable ''one model fits all'' recommender models. Our study not only demonstrates positive results but also uncovers unexpected negative outcomes, illuminating the current state of the TCF paradigm within the community. These findings will evoke deep reflection and inspire further research on text-based recommender systems.},

abstract = {On-demand cinemas are a new type of offline entertainment venues which have shown the rapid expansion in the recent years. Recommending movies of interest to the potential audiences in on-demand cinemas is keen but challenging because the recommendation scenario is totally different from all the existing recommendation applications including online video recommendation, offline item recommendation and group recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal approach called Pegasus. Because of the specific characteristics of on-demand cinema recommendation, Pegasus exploits the POI (Point of Interest) information around cinemas and the content descriptions of movies, apart from the historical movie consumption records of cinemas. Pegasus explores the temporal dynamics and spatial influences rooted in audience behaviors, and captures the similarities between cinemas, the changes of audience crowds, time-varying features and regional disparities of movie popularity. It offers an effective and explainable way to recommend movies to on-demand cinemas. The corresponding Pegasus system has been deployed in some pilot on-demand cinemas. Based on the real-world data from on-demand cinemas, extensive experiments as well as pilot tests are conducted. Both experimental results and post-deployment feedback show that Pegasus is effective.},

abstract = {LinkedIn is the largest professional social network in the world with more than 238M members. It provides a platform for advertisers to reach out to professionals and target them using rich profile and behavioral data. Thus, online advertising is an important business for LinkedIn. In this talk, I will give an overview of machine learning and optimization components that power LinkedIn self-serve display advertising systems. The talk will not only focus on machine learning and optimization methods, but various practical challenges that arise when running such components in a real production environment. I will describe how we overcome some of these challenges to bridge the gap between theory and practice.The major components that will be described in details include Response prediction: The goal of this component is to estimate click-through rates (CTR) when an ad is shown to a user in a given context. Given the data sparseness due to low CTR for advertising applications in general and the curse of dimensionality, estimating such interactions is known to be a challenging. Furthermore, the goal of the system is to maximize expected revenue, hence this is an explore/exploit problem and not a supervised learning problem. Our approach takes recourse to supervised learning to reduce dimensionality and couples it with classical explore/exploit schemes to balance the explore/exploit tradeoff. In particular, we use a large scale logistic regression to estimate user and ad interactions. Such interactions are comprised of two additive terms a) stable interactions captured by using features for both users and ads whose coefficients change slowly over time, and b) ephemeral interactions that capture ad-specific residual idiosyncrasies that are missed by the stable component. Exploration is introduced via Thompson sampling on the ephemeral interactions (sample coefficients from the posterior distribution), since the stable part is estimated using large amounts of data and subject to very little statistical variance. Our model training pipeline estimates the stable part using a scatter and gather approach via the ADMM algorithm, ephemeral part is estimated more frequently by learning a per ad correction through an ad-specific logistic regression. Scoring thousands of ads at runtime under tight latency constraints is a formidable challenge when using such models, the talk will describe methods to scale such computations at runtime.Automatic Format Selection: The presentation of ads in a given slot on a page has a significant impact on how users interact with them. Web designers are adept at creating good formats to facilitate ad display but selecting the best among those automatically is a machine learning task. I will describe a machine learning approach we use to solve this problem. It is again an explore/exploit problem but the dimensionality of this problem is much less than the ad selection problem. I will also provide a detailed description of how we deal with issues like budget pacing, bid forecasting, supply forecasting and targeting. Throughout, the ML components will be illustrated with real examples from production and evaluation metrics would be reported from live tests. Offline metrics that can be useful in evaluating methods before launching them on live traffic will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Neural Processes (NPs) are a family of supervised density estimators devoted to probabilistic function approximation with meta-learning. Despite extensive research on the subject, the absence of a unified framework for NPs leads to varied architectural solutions across diverse studies. This non-consensus poses challenges to reproducing and benchmarking different NPs. Moreover, existing codebases mainly prioritize generative density estimation, yet rarely consider expanding the capability of NPs to self-supervised representation learning, which however has gained growing importance in data mining applications. To this end, we present NP-SSL, a modular and configurable framework with built-in support, requiring minimal effort to 1) implement classical NPs architectures; 2) customize specific components; 3) integrate hybrid training scheme (e.g., contrastive); and 4) extend NPs to act as a self-supervised learning toolkit, producing latent representations of data, and facilitating diverse downstream predictive tasks. To illustrate, we discuss a case study that applies NP-SSL to model time-series data. We interpret that NP-SSL can handle different predictive tasks such as imputation and forecasting, by a simple switch in data samplings, without significant change to the underlying structure. We hope this study can reduce the workload of future research on leveraging NPs to tackle more a broader range of real-world data mining applications.

However, directly incorporating LLMs into an online inference pipeline significantly increases computation costs for large-scale deployment, posing a practical challenge in balancing their benefits and costs. In this work, we propose the EASE framework, which enriches and aligns semantic feature embeddings using LLMs during the training phase while establishing a lightweight inference pipeline that does not directly involve LLMs. Specifically, we train a semantic adapter to align item features with LLMs and simultaneously enrich semantic embeddings through reconstruction tasks from LLMs. During inference, we retain only the item feature encoder and lightweight semantic adapter, thereby eliminating the computation overhead of resource-intensive LLMs. Our EASE framework is flexible, supporting not only text and visual features but also other pre-processed embedding features. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate that enriching semantic feature embeddings with our EASE framework yields consistent improvements in downstream click-through rate prediction tasks.},

abstract = {The logged feedback for training recommender systems is usually subject to selection bias, which could not reflect real user preference. Thus, many efforts have been made to learn the de-biased recommender system from biased feedback. However, existing methods for dealing with selection bias are usually affected by the error of propensity weight estimation, have high variance, or assume access to uniform data, which is expensive to be collected in practice. In this work, we address these issues by proposing Learning De-biased Representations (LDR), a framework derived from the representation learning perspective. LDR bridges the gap between propensity weight estimation (WE) and unbiased weighted learning (WL) and provides an end-to-end solution that iteratively conducts WE and WL. We show LDR can effectively alleviate selection bias with bounded variance. We also perform theoretical analysis on the statistical properties of LDR, such as its bias, variance, and generalization performance. Extensive experiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LDR.},

abstract = {Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction serves as a fundamental component in online advertising. A common practice is to train a CTR model on advertisement (ad) impressions with user feedback. Since ad impressions are purposely selected by the model itself, their distribution differs from the inference distribution and thus exhibits sample selection bias (SSB) that affects model performance. Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting techniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration. Another line of work relies on costly uniform data that is inadequate to train industrial models. Thus mitigating SSB in industrial models with a uniform-data-free framework is worth exploring. Fortunately, many platforms display mixed results of organic items (i.e., recommendations) and sponsored items (i.e., ads) to users, where impressions of ads and recommendations are selected by different systems but share the same user decision rationales. Based on the above characteristics, we propose to leverage recommendations samples as a free lunch to mitigate SSB for ads CTR model (Rec4Ad). After elaborating data augmentation, Rec4Ad learns disentangled representations with alignment and decorrelation modules for enhancement. When deployed in Taobao display advertising system, Rec4Ad achieves substantial gains in key business metrics, with a lift of up to +6.6% CTR and +2.9% RPM.},

abstract = {Personalized item ranking has been a crucial component contributing to the performance of recommender systems. As a representative approach, pairwise ranking directly optimizes the ranking with user implicit feedback by constructing ( user, positive item, negative item ) triplets. Several recent works have noticed that treating all triplets equally may hardly achieve the best effects. They assign different importance scores to negative items, user-item pairs, or triplets, respectively. However, almost all the generated importance scores are groundless and hard to interpret, thus far from trustworthy and transparent. To tackle these, we propose the Triplet Shapley ---a Shapely value-based method to measure the triplet importance in an interpretable manner. Due to the huge number of triplets, we transform the original Shapley value calculation to the Monte Carlo (MC) approximation. To stabilize the MC approximation, we adopt a control covariates-based scheme. Finally, we utilize the triplet Shapley values to guide the resampling of important triplets for facilitating the model learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public datasets involving classical matrix factorization- and graph neural network-based recommendation models to demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

abstract = {Increasing urbanization across the globe has coincided with greater access to urban data; this enables researchers and city administrators with better tools to understand urban dynamics, such as crime, traffic, and living standards. In this paper, we study the Learning an Embedding Space for Regions (LESR) problem, wherein we aim to produce vector representations of discrete regions. Recent studies have shown that embedding geospatial regions in a latent vector space can be useful in a variety of urban computing tasks. However, previous studies do not consider regions across multiple modalities in an end-to-end framework. We argue that doing so facilitates the learning of greater semantic relationships among regions. We propose a novel method, RegionEncoder, that jointly learns region representations from satellite image, point-of-interest, human mobility, and spatial graph data. We demonstrate that these region embeddings are useful as features in two regression tasks and across two distinct urban environments. Additionally, we perform an ablation study that evaluates each major architectural component. Finally, we qualitatively explore the learned embedding space, and show that semantic relationships are discovered across modalities},

abstract = {This paper proposes to jointly resolve row-wise and column-wise ranking problems when an explicit rating matrix is given. The row-wise ranking problem, also known as personalized ranking, aims to build user-specific models such that the correct order of items (in terms of user preference) is most accurately predicted and then items on the top of ranked list will be recommended to a specific user, while column-wise ranking aims to build item-specific models focusing on targeting users who are most interested in the specific item (for example, for distributing coupons to customers). In recommender systems, ranking-based collaborative filtering (known as collaborative ranking (CR)) algorithms are designed to solve the aforementioned ranking problems. The key part of CR algorithms is to learn effective user and item latent factors which are combined to decide user preference scores over items. In this paper, we demonstrate that by individually solving row-wise or column-wise ranking problems using typical CR algorithms is only able to learn one set of effective (user or item) latent factors. Therefore, we propose to jointly solve row-wise and column-wise ranking problems through a parameter sharing framework which optimizes three objectives together: to accurately predict rating scores, to satisfy the user-specific order constraints on all the rated items, and to satisfy the item-specific order constraints. Our extensive experimental results on popular datasets confirm significant performance gains of our proposed method over state-of-the-art CR approaches in both of row-wise and column-wise ranking tasks.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are widely applied on web. For example, online advertising systems rely on recommender systems to accurately estimate the value of display opportunities, which is critical to maximize the profits of advertisers. To reduce computational resource consumption, the core tactic of Multi-Scenario Multi-Task Learning (MSMTL) is to devise a single recommder system that is adapted to all contexts instead of implementing multiple scenario-oriented or task-oriented recommender systems. However, MSMTL is challenging because there are complicated task-task, scenario-scenario, and task-scenario interrelations; the characteristic of different tasks in different scenarios also largely varies; and samples of each context are often unevenly distributed. Previous MSMTL solutions focus on applying scenario knowledge to improve the performance of multi-task learning, while neglecting the complicated interrelations among tasks and scenarios. Moreover, samples derived from different scenarios are transferred into the latent embedding with the same dimension. This static embedding strategy impedes the practicality of model expressiveness, since the scenarios with sufficient samples are underrepresented and those with insufficient samples are over-represented.In this paper, we propose a novel three meta networks-based solution (3MN) to MSMTL that addresses all the limitations discussed above. Specifically, we innovatively bind the meta network with scenario-related input in bottom embedding layer, so that the embedding layer is capable of learning the scenario-related knowledge explicitly. To counteract the imbalanced scenario-related data distributions, our flexible embedding layer adaptively learns the representation of samples. This innovative embedding layer is also able to boost other solutions as a plug-in. Moreover, to fully capture the interrelations among scenarios and tasks, we enforce the task and scenario information into the other two meta networks, and transfer the resulted meta-knowledge into the top components (i.e., backbone network and classifier) of the recommender system, respectively. These three meta networks contribute to the superiority of our 3MN solution over state-of-the-art MSMTL solutions, which is demonstrated by extensive offline experiments. 3MN has been successfully deployed in our industrial online advertising system.},

abstract = {In the era of big data, online doctor review platforms, which enable patients to give feedback to their doctors, have become one of the most important components in healthcare systems. On one hand, they help patients to choose their doctors based on the experience of others. On the other hand, they help doctors to improve the quality of their service. Moreover, they provide important sources for us to discover common concerns of patients and existing problems in clinics, which potentially improve current healthcare systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the dataset from one of such review platform, namely, ratemds.com, where each review for a doctor comes with an overall rating and ratings of four different aspects. A comprehensive statistical analysis is conducted first for reviews, ratings, and doctors. Then, we explore the content of reviews by extracting latent topics related to different aspects with unsupervised topic modeling techniques. As the core component of this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework for the document-level multi-aspect sentiment classification. This task helps us to not only recover missing aspect-level ratings and detect inconsistent rating scores but also identify aspect-keywords for a given review based on ratings. The proposed model takes both features of doctors and aspect-keywords into consideration. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two subsets of ratemds dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Federated recommendation applies federated learning techniques in recommendation systems to help protect user privacy by exchanging models instead of raw user data between user devices and the central server. Due to the heterogeneity in user's attributes and local data, attaining personalized models is critical to help improve the federated recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network based Personalized Federated Recommendation (PerFedRec) framework via joint representation learning, user clustering, and model adaptation. Specifically, we construct a collaborative graph and incorporate attribute information to jointly learn the representation through a federated GNN. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users into different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster. Then each user learns a personalized model by combining the global federated model, the cluster-level federated model, and the user's fine-tuned local model. To alleviate the heavy communication burden, we intelligently select a few representative users (instead of randomly picked users) from each cluster to participate in training. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance over existing methods.},

abstract = {Cold start is a challenge in product search. Profuse literature addresses related problems such as bias and diversity in search, and cold start is a classic topic in recommender systems research. While search cold start might be seen conceptually as a particular case in such areas, we find that available solutions fail to specifically and practically solve the cold-start problem in product search. The problem is complex as exposing new products may come at the expense of primary business metrics (e.g. revenue), and involves a complex balance between customer satisfaction, seller satisfaction, business performance, short-term gains and long-term value.In this paper, we propose a principled approach to deal with cold start in a large-scale e-commerce search system. We discuss how product ranking is affected by non-behavioral topical relevance and behavioral popularity, and their role in introducing biases that result in cold-start for ranking new products. Our approach applies Empirical Bayes to model behavioral information via non-behavioral signals in terms of priors, and effectively estimate true engagement posterior updates. We report comprehensive offline and online experiments over large datasets that show the effectiveness of our methods to address cold start, and provide further insights. An online A/B test on 50 million queries shows a significant improvement in new product impressions by 13.53% and a significant increase in new product purchase by 11.14%, with overall purchases up by 0.08%, highlighting the empirical effectiveness of the approach.},

abstract = {Federated recommender systems are used to address privacy issues in recommendations. Among them, FedVAE extends the representative non-linear recommendation method MultVAE. However, the bottleneck of FedVAE lies in its communication load during training, as the parameter volume of its first and last layers is correlated with the number of items. This leads to significant communication cost during the model's transmission phases (distribution and upload), making FedVAE's implementation extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Federated Variational AutoEncoder for collaborative filtering, EFVAE, which core is the Federated Collaborative Importance Sampling (FCIS) method. FCIS reduces communication costs through a client-to-server collaborative sampling mechanism and provides satisfactory recommendation performance through dynamic multi-stage approximation of the decoding distribution. Extensive experiments and analyses on real-world datasets confirm that EFVAE significantly reduces communication costs by up to 94.51% while maintaining the recommendation performance. Moreover, its recommendation performance is better on sparse datasets, with improvements reaching up to 13.79%.},

abstract = {Context-aware Recommendations (CARS) have attracted a lot of attention recently because of the impact of contextual information on user behaviors. Recent state-of-the-art methods represent the relations between users/items and contexts as a tensor, with which it is difficult to distinguish the impacts of different contextual factors and to model complex, non-linear interactions between contexts and users/items. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model, named Attentive Interaction Network (AIN), to enhance CARS through adaptively capturing the interactions between contexts and users/items. Specifically, AIN contains an Interaction-Centric Module to capture the interaction effects of contexts on users/items; a User-Centric Module and an Item-Centric Module to model respectively how the interaction effects influence the user and item representations. The user and item representations under interaction effects are combined to predict the recommendation scores. We further employ effect-level attention mechanism to aggregate multiple interaction effects. Extensive experiments on two rating datasets and one ranking dataset show that the proposed AIN outperforms state-of-the-art CARS methods. In addition, we also find that AIN provides recommendations with better explanation ability with respect to contexts than the existing approaches.},

Existing methods generally consider user re-sharing behaviors to be driven by a single intent, and/or assume cascade temporal influence to be unchanged, which might not be consistent with real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised disentanglement framework (DisenIDP) for information diffusion prediction. First, we construct intent-aware hypergraphs to capture users' potential intents from different perspectives, and then perform the light hypergraph convolution to adaptively activate disentangled intents. Second, we extract long-term and short-term cascade influence via independent attention-based encoders. Finally, we set a self-supervised disentanglement task to alleviate the information loss and learn better-disentanglement representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world social datasets demonstrate that DisenIDP outperforms state-of-the-art models across several settings.},

abstract = {Capturing the temporal dynamics of user preferences over items is important for recommendation. Existing methods mainly assume that all time steps in user-item interaction history are equally relevant to recommendation, which however does not apply in real-world scenarios where user-item interactions can often happen accidentally. More importantly, they learn user and item dynamics separately, thus failing to capture their joint effects on user-item interactions. To better model user and item dynamics, we present the Interacting Attention-gated Recurrent Network (IARN) which adopts the attention model to measure the relevance of each time step. In particular, we propose a novel attention scheme to learn the attention scores of user and item history in an interacting way, thus to account for the dependencies between user and item dynamics in shaping user-item interactions. By doing so, IARN can selectively memorize different time steps of a user's history when predicting her preferences over different items. Our model can therefore provide meaningful interpretations for recommendation results, which could be further enhanced by auxiliary features. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that IARN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to determine whether students will respond correctly to the next question, which is a crucial task in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In educational KT scenarios, transductive ID-based methods often face severe data sparsity and cold start problems, where interactions between individual students and questions are sparse, and new questions and concepts consistently arrive in the database. In addition, existing KT models only implicitly consider the correlation between concepts and questions, lacking direct modeling of the more complex relationships in the heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions. In this paper, we propose a &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;tructure-aware &lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt;ductive &lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt;nowledge &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;racing model with large language model (dubbed SINKT), which, for the first time, introduces large language models (LLMs) and realizes inductive knowledge tracing. Firstly, SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a hetero- geneous graph for concepts and questions. Secondly, by encoding concepts and questions with LLMs, SINKT incorporates semantic information to aid prediction. Finally, SINKT predicts the student's response to the target question by interacting with the student's knowledge state and the question representation. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT achieves state-of-the-art performance among 12 existing transductive KT models. Additionally, we explore the performance of SINKT on the inductive KT task and provide insights into various modules.},

However, it is non-trivial to eliminate the popularity bias by exploiting the textual semantics. One major obstacle is that the model supervision still counts on the sparse yet binary user behaviors. In the preliminary investigation, we discover that text-based recommendations also suffer from the popularity bias.To this end, we propose a novel self-distillation framework based on a pre-trained language model, named Staple. The proposed Staple consists of two main components: ranker model and recommender model, which are both instantiated as a PLM towards exploiting the item textual semantics. Motivated by the recent success of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), the proposed Staple aims to recover the relative preference by learning a fair ranker model that can successfully distinguish the preference levels for uninteracted items. Specifically, analogous to the training of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a pre-training and a fair supervised fine-tuning with a decoupled layer to build the ranker model. Then, similar to RLHF for LLM training, we utilize the relative preference information estimated by the ranker over candidate items to complement the learning of the recommender model. We show that this RLHF process can be reformed as an efficient distillation learning process. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. In addition to the performance metrics, we employ two additional metrics to measure fairness and debiased performance. The experiments show that our method can significantly improve the item exposure fairness of recommendation and mitigate popularity bias, while also improving the recommendation performance.

abstract = {Adversarial examples can be detrimental to a recommender,leading to a surging enthusiasm for applying adversarial learning to improve recommendation performance, e.g. raising model robustness, alleviating data sparsity, generating initial profiles for cold-start users or items, etc. Most existing adversarial example generation methods fall within three categories: attacking the user-item interactions or auxiliary contents, adding perturbations in latent space, sampling the latent space according to certain distribution. In this work, we focus on the semantic-rich user-item interactions in a recommender system and propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) named Convolutional Generative Collaborative Filtering (Conv-GCF). We develop an effective perturbation mechanism (adversarial noise layer) for convolutional neural networks (CNN), based on which we design a generator with residual blocks to synthesize user-item interactions. We empirically demonstrate that on Conv-GCF, the adversarial noise layer is superior to the conventional noise-adding approach. Moreover, we propose two types of discriminators: one using Bayes Personalized Ranking (BPR) and the other with binary classification. On four public datasets, we show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art top-n recommendation performance among competitive baselines.},

abstract = {In recommendation systems (RS), user behavior data is observational rather than experimental, resulting in widespread bias in the data. Consequently, tackling bias has emerged as a major challenge in the field of recommendation systems. Recently, Doubly Robust Learning (DR) has gained significant attention due to its remarkable performance and robust properties. However, our experimental findings indicate that existing DR methods are severely impacted by the presence of so-called Poisonous Imputation, where the imputation significantly deviates from the truth and becomes counterproductive.To address this issue, this work proposes Conservative Doubly Robust strategy (CDR) which filters imputations by scrutinizing their mean and variance. Theoretical analyses show that CDR offers reduced variance and improved tail bounds.In addition, our experimental investigations illustrate that CDR significantly enhances performance and can indeed reduce the frequency of poisonous imputation.},

abstract = {Venue recommendation is an important capability of Location-Based Social Networks such as Yelp and Foursquare. Matrix Factorisation (MF) is a collaborative filtering-based approach that can effectively recommend venues that are relevant to the users' preferences, by training upon either implicit or explicit feedbacks (e.g. check-ins or venue ratings) that these users express about venues. However, MF suffers in that users may only have rated very few venues. To alleviate this problem, recent literature have leveraged additional sources of evidence, e.g. using users' social friendships to reduce the complexity of - or regularise - the MF model, or identifying similar venues based on their comments. This paper argues for a combined regularisation model, where the venues suggested for a user are influenced by friends with similar tastes (as defined by their comments). We propose a MF regularisation technique that seamlessly incorporates both social network information and textual comments, by exploiting word embeddings to estimate a semantic similarity of friends based on their explicit textual feedback, to regularise the complexity of the factorised model. Experiments on a large existing dataset demonstrate that our proposed regularisation model is promising, and can enhance the prediction accuracy of several state-of-the-art matrix factorisation-based approaches.},

abstract = {In many recommendation settings, the candidate items for recommendation are associated with a maximum capacity, i.e., number of seats in a Point-of-Interest (POI) or number of item copies in the inventory. However, despite the prevalence of the capacity constraint in the recommendation process, the existing recommendation methods are not designed to optimize for respecting such a constraint. Towards closing this gap, we propose Recommendation with Capacity Constraints -- a framework that optimizes for both recommendation accuracy and expected item usage that respects the capacity constraints. We show how to apply our method to three state-of-the-art latent factor recommendation models: probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF), bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) for item recommendation, and geographical matrix factorization (GeoMF) for POI recommendation. Our experiments indicate that our framework is effective for providing good recommendations while taking the limited resources into consideration. Interestingly, our methods are shown in some cases to further improve the top-N recommendation quality of the respective unconstrained models.},

abstract = {The proliferation of online video content has triggered numerous works on its evolution and popularity, as well as on the effect of social sharing on content propagation. In this paper, we focus on the observable dependencies between the virality of video content on a micro-blogging social network (in this case, Twitter) and the popularity of such content on a video distribution service (YouTube). To this end, we collected and analysed a corpus of Twitter posts containing links to YouTube clips and the corresponding video meta-data from YouTube. Our analysis highlights the unique properties of content that is both popular and viral, which allows such content to attract high number of views on YouTube and achieve fast propagation on Twitter. With this in mind, we proceed to the predictions of popular-and-viral clips and propose a framework that can, with high degree of accuracy and low amount of training data, predict videos that are likely to be popular, viral, and both. The key contribution of our work is the focus on cross-system dynamics between YouTube and Twitter. We conjecture and validate that cross-system prediction of both popularity and virality of videos is feasible, and can be performed with a reasonably high degree of accuracy. One of our key findings is that YouTube features capturing user engagement, have strong virality prediction capabilities. This findings allows to solely rely on data extracted from a video sharing service to predict popularity and virality aspects of videos.},

With increasing concerns on the transparency and accountability of AI systems, studies on explainable information retrieval has received more and more attention in the research community. Interestingly, in the domain of e-commerce, despite the extensive studies on explainable product recommendation, the studies of explainable product search is still in an early stage. In this paper, we study how to construct effective explainable product search by comparing model-agnostic explanation paradigms with model-intrinsic paradigms and analyzing the important factors that determine the performance of product search explanations. We propose an explainable product search model with model-intrinsic interpretability and conduct crowdsourcing to compare it with the state-of-the-art explainable product search model with model-agnostic interpretability. We observe that both paradigms have their own advantages and the effectiveness of search explanations on different properties are affected by different factors. For example, explanation fidelity is more important for user's overall satisfaction on the system while explanation novelty may be more useful in attracting user purchases. These findings could have important implications for the future studies and design of explainable product search engines.},

abstract = {Users in music streaming platforms typically consume tracks sequentially in sessions by interacting with personalised playlists. To satisfy users, music platforms usually rely on recommender systems that learn users' preferences over individual tracks and rank the tracks within each playlist according to the learned preferences. However, such rankings often do not fully exploit the sequential nature of the users' consumption, which may result in a lower within-a-session consumption. In this paper, we model the sequential within-a-session preferences of users and propose an optimisation-based sequencing approach that allows for optimally incorporating such preferences into the rankings. To this end, we rely on interaction data of a major music streaming service to identify two most common aspects of the users' sequential preferences: (1) Position-Aware preferences, and (2) Local-Sequential preferences. We propose a sequencing model that can leverage each of these aspects optimally to maximise the expected total consumption from the session. We further perform an extensive offline and off-policy evaluation of our model, and carry out a large scale online randomised control trial with 7M users across 80 countries. Our findings confirm that we can effectively incorporate sequential preferences of users into our sequencer to make users complete more and skip less tracks within their listening sessions.},

abstract = {In recent times, deep neural networks have found success in Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommendation tasks. By parametrizing latent factor interactions of users and items with neural architectures, they achieve significant gains in scalability and performance over matrix factorization. However, the long-tail phenomenon in recommender performance persists on the massive inventories of online media or retail platforms. Given the diversity of neural architectures and applications, there is a need to develop a generalizable and principled strategy to enhance long-tail item coverage.In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training strategy to enhance long-tail recommendations for users with Neural CF (NCF) models. The adversary network learns the implicit association structure of entities in the feedback data while the NCF model is simultaneously trained to reproduce these associations and avoid the adversarial penalty, resulting in enhanced long-tail performance. Experimental results show that even without auxiliary data, adversarial training can boost long-tail recall of state-of-the-art NCF models by up to 25%, without trading-off overall performance. We evaluate our approach on two diverse platforms, content tag recommendation in Q&amp;A forums and movie recommendation.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest among researchers to leverage these models to enhance Recommender Systems (RSs). Existing work predominantly utilizes LLMs to generate knowledge-rich texts or utilizes LLM-derived embeddings as features to improve RSs. Although the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs generally benefits RSs, the application can only take a limited number of users and items as inputs, without adequately exploiting collaborative filtering information. Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distills the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into collaborative filtering. We also explored a concise and efficient instruction-tuning method, which improves the recommendation capabilities of LLMs while preserving their general functionalities (e.g., not decreasing on the LLM benchmark). Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-CF significantly enhances several backbone recommendation models and consistently outperforms competitive baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in distilling the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering.},

By conducting shilling attacks on recommender systems, the attackers aim to have homogeneous impacts on all users. However, such indiscriminate attacks suffer from a waste of resources because even if the target item is promoted to users who are not interested, they are unlikely to click on them. In this paper, we conduct targeted shilling attacks in GNN-based recommender systems. By automatically constructing the features and edges of the fake users, our proposed framework AutoAttack achieves accurate attacks on a specific group of users while minimizing the impact on non-target users. Specifically, the features of fake users are generated based on a similarity function, which is optimized according to the features of target users. The structure of fake users is learned by conducting spectral clustering on the target users based on their graph Laplacian matrix, which contains the degree and adjacency information that provides guidance to the edge generation of fake users. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets in different GNN-based RS and evaluate the performance of our method on the shilling attack and recommendation tasks comprehensively, showing the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework.},

abstract = {Recommendation retrievers commonly retrieve user potentially preferred items from numerous items, where the query and item representation are learned according to the dual encoders with the log-softmax loss. Under real scenarios, the number of items becomes considerably large, making it exceedingly difficult to calculate the partition function with the whole item corpus. Negative sampling, which samples a subset from the item corpus, is widely used to accelerate the model training. Among different samplers, the in-batch sampling is commonly adopted for online recommendation retrievers, which regards the other items within the mini-batch as the negative samples for the given query, owing to its time and memory efficiency. However, the sample selection bias occurs due to the skewed feedback, harming the retrieval quality. In this paper, we propose a negative sampling approach named Batch-Mix Negative Sampling (BMNS), which adopts batch mixing operation to generate additional negatives for model training. Concretely, BMNS first generates new negative items with the sampled mix coefficient from the Beta distribution, after which a tailored correct strategy guided by frequency is designed to match the sampled softmax loss. In this way, the effort of re-encoding items out of the mini-batch is reduced while also improving the representation space of the negative set. The empirical experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate BMNS is superior to the competitive negative inbatch sampling method.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) employ user-item feedback, e.g., ratings, to match customers to personalized lists of products. Approaches to top-k recommendation mainly rely on Learning-To-Rank algorithms and, among them, the most widely adopted is Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which bases on a pair-wise optimization approach. Recently, BPR has been found vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of its model parameters. Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR) mitigates this issue by robustifying BPR via an adversarial training procedure. The empirical improvements of APR's accuracy performance on BPR have led to its wide use in several recommender models. However, a key overlooked aspect has been the beyond-accuracy performance of APR, i.e., novelty, coverage, and amplification of popularity bias, considering that recent results suggest that BPR, the building block of APR, is sensitive to the intensification of biases and reduction of recommendation novelty. In this work, we model the learning characteristics of the BPR and APR optimization frameworks to give mathematical evidence that, when the feedback data have a tailed distribution, APR amplifies the popularity bias more than BPR due to an unbalanced number of received positive updates from short-head items. Using matrix factorization (MF), we empirically validate the theoretical results by performing preliminary experiments on two public datasets to compare BPR-MF and APR-MF performance on accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics. The experimental results consistently show the degradation of novelty and coverage measures and a worrying amplification of bias.},

abstract = {LensKit is an open-source toolkit for building, researching, and learning about recommender systems. First released in 2010 as a Java framework, it has supported diverse published research, small-scale production deployments, and education in both MOOC and traditional classroom settings. In this paper, I present the next generation of the LensKit project, re-envisioning the original tool's objectives as flexible Python package for supporting recommender systems research and development. LensKit for Python (LKPY) enables researchers and students to build robust, flexible, and reproducible experiments that make use of the large and growing PyData and Scientific Python ecosystem, including scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. To that end, it provides classical collaborative filtering implementations, recommender system evaluation metrics, data preparation routines, and tools for efficiently batch running recommendation algorithms, all usable in any combination with each other or with other Python software.  This paper describes the design goals, use cases, and capabilities of LKPY, contextualized in a reflection on the successes and failures of the original LensKit for Java software.},

TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits of pretrained language models to recommendation systems.

This is the largest public real-world conversational recommendation dataset to date. (2) Evaluation: On the new dataset and two existing conversational recommendation datasets, we observe that even without fine-tuning, large language models can outperform existing fine-tuned conversational recommendation models. (3) Analysis: We propose various probing tasks to investigate the mechanisms behind the remarkable performance of large language models in conversational recommendation. We analyze both the large language models' behaviors and the characteristics of the datasets, providing a holistic understanding of the models' effectiveness, limitations and suggesting directions for the design of future conversational recommenders.},

abstract = {The Web has accumulated a rich source of information, such as text, image, rating, etc, which represent different aspects of user preferences. However, the heterogeneous nature of this information makes it difficult for recommender systems to leverage in a unified framework to boost the performance. Recently, the rapid development of representation learning techniques provides an approach to this problem. By translating the various information sources into a unified representation space, it becomes possible to integrate heterogeneous information for informed recommendation.  In this work, we propose a Joint Representation Learning (JRL) framework for top-N recommendation. In this framework, each type of information source (review text, product image, numerical rating, etc) is adopted to learn the corresponding user and item representations based on available (deep) representation learning architectures. Representations from different sources are integrated with an extra layer to obtain the joint representations for users and items. In the end, both the per-source and the joint representations are trained as a whole using pair-wise learning to rank for top-N recommendation. We analyze how information propagates among different information sources in a gradient-descent learning paradigm, based on which we further propose an extendable version of the JRL framework (eJRL), which is rigorously extendable to new information sources to avoid model re-training in practice. By representing users and items into embeddings offline, and using a simple vector multiplication for ranking score calculation online, our framework also has the advantage of fast online prediction compared with other deep learning approaches to recommendation that learn a complex prediction network for online calculation.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems (RS) are crucial for alleviating the information overload problem. Due to its pivotal role in guiding users to make decisions, unscrupulous parties are lured to launch attacks against RS to affect the decisions of normal users and gain illegal profits. Among various types of attacks, shilling attack is one of the most subsistent and profitable attacks. In shilling attack, an adversarial party injects a number of well-designed fake user profiles into the system to mislead RS so that the attack goal can be achieved. Although existing shilling attack methods have achieved promising results, they all adopt the attack paradigm of multi-user injection, where some fake user profiles are required. This paper provides the first study of shilling attack in an extremely limited scenario: only one fake user profile is injected into the victim RS to launch shilling attacks (i.e., single-user injection). We propose a novel single-user injection method SUI-Attack for invisible shilling attack. SUI-Attack is a graph based attack method that models shilling attack as a node generation task over the user-item bipartite graph of the victim RS, and it constructs the fake user profile by generating user features and edges that link the fake user to items. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SUI-Attack can achieve promising attack results in single-user injection. In addition to its attack power, SUI-Attack increases the stealthiness of shilling attack and reduces the risk of being detected. We provide our implementation at: https://github.com/KDEGroup/SUI-Attack.},

Negative sampling plays a vital role in training CF-based models with implicit feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective based on the sampling area to revisit existing sampling methods. We point out that current sampling methods mainly focus on Point-wise or Line-wise sampling, lacking flexibility and leaving a significant portion of the hard sampling area un-explored. To address this limitation, we propose Dimension Independent Mixup for Hard Negative Sampling (DINS), which is the first Area-wise sampling method for training CF-based models. DINS comprises three modules: Hard Boundary Definition, Dimension Independent Mixup, and Multi-hop Pooling. Experiments with real-world datasets on both matrix factorization and graph-based models demonstrate that DINS outperforms other negative sampling methods, establishing its effectiveness and superiority. Our work contributes a new perspective, introduces Area-wise sampling, and presents DINS as a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance for negative sampling. Our implementations are available in PyTorch.},

In this paper, we propose a method for simulating the users interaction with the recommenders in an offline setting and study the impact of feedback loop on the popularity bias amplification of several recommendation algorithms. We then show how this bias amplification leads to several other problems such as declining the aggregate diversity, shifting the representation of users' taste over time and also homogenization of the users. In particular, we show that the impact of feedback loop is generally stronger for the users who belong to the minority group.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous long-tail distribution of inherent user behaviors results in worse recommendation performance for the items with fewer user records (i.e., tail items) than those with richer ones (i.e., head items). Graph-based recommendation methods (e.g., using graph neural networks) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for recommender systems, often outperforming traditional methods. However, existing techniques for alleviating the long-tail problem mainly focus on traditional methods. There is a lack of graph-based methods that can efficiently deal with the long-tail problem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Graph Augmentation for Long-tail Recommendation (GALORE), which can be plugged into any graph-based recommendation models to improve the performance for tail items. GALORE incorporates an edge addition module that enriches the graph's connectivity for tail items by injecting additional item-to-item edges. To further balance the graph structure, GALORE utilizes a degree-aware edge dropping strategy, preserving the more valuable edges from the tail items while selectively discarding less informative edges from the head items. Beyond structural augmentation, we synthesize new data samples, thereby addressing the data scarcity issue for tail items. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy to facilitate the learning for both head and tail items. Comprehensive empirical studies conducted on four datasets show that GALORE outperforms existing methods in terms of the performance for tail items as well as the overall performance.},

This paper presents a novel paradigm for the Zero-Shot Item-based Recommendation (ZSIR) task, which pre-trains a model on product knowledge graph (PKG) to refine the item features from PLMs. We identify three challenges for pre-training PKG, which are multi-type relations in PKG, semantic divergence between item generic information and relations and domain discrepancy from PKG to downstream ZSIR task. We address the challenges by proposing four pre-training tasks and novel task-oriented adaptation (ToA) layers. Moreover, this paper discusses how to fine-tune the model on new recommendation task such that the ToA layers are adapted to ZSIR task. Comprehensive experiments on 18 markets dataset are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MPKG model.},

abstract = {Different from shopping at retail stores, consumers on e-commerce platforms usually cannot touch or try products before purchasing, which means that they have to make decisions when they are uncertain about the outcome (e.g., satisfaction level) of purchasing a product. To study people's preferences with regard to choices that have uncertain outcomes, economics researchers have proposed the hypothesis of Expected Utility (EU) that models the subject value associated with an individual's choice as the statistical expectations of that individual's valuations of the outcomes of this choice. Despite its success in studies of game theory and decision theory, the effectiveness of EU, however, is mostly unknown in e-commerce recommendation systems. Previous research on e-commerce recommendation interprets the utility of purchase decisions either as a function of the consumed quantity of the product or as the gain of sellers/buyers in the monetary sense. As most consumers just purchase one unit of a product at a time and most alternatives have similar prices, such modeling of purchase utility is likely to be inaccurate in practice. In this paper, we interpret purchase utility as the satisfaction level a consumer gets from a product and propose a recommendation framework using EU to model consumers' behavioral patterns. We assume that consumer estimates the expected utilities of all the alternatives and choose products with maximum expected utility for each purchase. To deal with the potential psychological biases of each consumer, we introduce the usage of Probability Weight Function (PWF) and design our algorithm based on Weighted Expected Utility (WEU). Empirical study on real-world e-commerce datasets shows that our proposed ranking-based recommendation framework achieves statistically significant improvement against both classical Collaborative Filtering/Latent Factor Models and state-of-the-art deep models in top-K recommendation.},

However, in practice several real-world problems decrease their ranking performance, such as the sparsity and cold-start problems, which often occur in recommendation systems for inactive or new users. In this study, to account for the fact that the selections of social friends can improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a joint CR model based on the users' social relationships. We propose two different CR strategies based on the notions of Social Reverse Height and Social Height, which consider how well the relevant and irrelevant items of users and their social friends have been ranked at the top of the list, respectively. We focus on the top of the list mainly because users see the top-N recommendations in real-world applications, and not the whole ranked list. Furthermore, we formulate a joint objective function to consider both CR strategies, and propose an alternating minimization algorithm to learn our joint CR model. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed joint CR model outperforms other state-of-the-art models that either consider social relationships or focus on the ranking performance at the top of the list.},

abstract = {Existing review-based recommendation models mainly learn long- term user and item representations from a set of reviews. Due to the ignorance of rich side information of reviews, these models suffer from two drawbacks: 1) they fail to capture short-term changes of user preferences and item features reflected in reviews and 2) they cannot accurately model high-order user-item collaborative signals from reviews. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-view approach named Set-Sequence-Graph (SSG), to augment existing single-view (i.e., view of set) methods by introducing two additional views of exploiting reviews: sequence and graph. In particular, with reviews organized in forms of set, sequence, and graph respectively, we design a three-way encoder architecture that jointly captures long-term (set), short-term (sequence), and collaborative (graph) features of users and items for recommendation. For the sequence encoder, we propose a short-term priority attention network that explicitly takes the order and personalized time intervals of reviews into consideration. For the graph encoder, we design a novel review-aware graph attention network to model high-order multi-aspect relations in the user-item graph. To combat the potential redundancy in captured features, our fusion module employs a cross-view decorrelation mechanism to encourage diverse representations from multiple views for integration. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that SSG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {User cold-start recommendation is one of the most challenging problems that limit the effectiveness of recommender systems. Meta-learning-based methods are introduced to address this problem by learning initialization parameters for cold-start tasks. Recent studies attempt to enhance the initialization methods. They first represent each task by the cold-start user and interacted items. Then they distinguish tasks based on the task relevance to learn adaptive initialization. However, this manner is based on the assumption that user preferences can be reflected by the interacted items saliently, which is not always true in reality. In addition, we argue that previous approaches suffer from their adaptive framework (e.g., adaptive initialization), which reduces the adaptability in the process of transferring meta-knowledge to personalized RSs. In response to the issues, we propose a task-difficulty-aware meta-learning with adaptive update strategies (TDAS) for user cold-start recommendation. First, we design a task difficulty encoder, which can represent user preference salience, task relevance, and other task characteristics by modeling task difficulty information. Second, we adopt a novel framework with task-adaptive local update strategies by optimizing the initialization parameters with task-adaptive per-step and per-layer hyperparameters. Extensive experiments based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our TDAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/XuHao-bit/TDAS.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems have proliferated as general-purpose approaches to model a wide variety of consumer interaction data. Specific instances make use of signals ranging from user feedback, item relationships, geographic locality, social influence (etc.). Typically, research proceeds by showing that making use of a specific signal (within a carefully designed model) allows for higher-fidelity recommendations on a particular dataset. Of course, the real situation is more nuanced, in which a combination of many signals may be at play, or favored in different proportion by individual users. Here we seek to develop a framework that is capable of combining such heterogeneous item relationships by simultaneously modeling (a) what modality of recommendation is a user likely to be susceptible to at a particular point in time; and (b) what is the best recommendation from each modality. Our method borrows ideas from mixtures-of-experts approaches as well as knowledge graph embeddings. We find that our approach naturally yields more accurate recommendations than alternatives, while also providing intuitive 'explanations' behind the recommendations it provides.},

abstract = {The goal of Jobs Marketplace at LinkedIn is to match members to promoted job postings such that both job posters' ROI is optimized (amount of money spent per job clicks and applications) and the members are presented with relevant jobs that they are interested in and qualified for. This is achieved via a first-price auction mechanism where each job provides a bid for the member that comes to the job recommendations page. This bid depends on the match of the member to the job, as well as the daily budget that remains for the job, and its capability to spend it via clicks (e.g. some jobs might have more demand and have it easier to spend their budgets via clicks than others). In such a scheme, budget pacing, i.e. the capability of a job to spend its daily budget evenly, or according to a preset plan, is extremely important towards efficient utilization of its budget via reaching a higher number of candidates, and obey a variety of spending plans optimizing for different events such as clicks and applications.In this paper, we propose an impression-based spend computation system, hence an impression-based pacing scheme. This approach works via assigning a projected/expected charge amount each time a job is shown to the user, taking into account both the likelihood that the user will click the job, and the recommender system specific considerations such as the order within a page that a job is recommended. The results of our alternate-day test shows that such a scheme leads to a smoother spending and improved adherence to the planned spend, and increases secondary metrics such as job clicks and applications.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems in auction platforms like eBay function differently in comparison to those found in traditional trading platforms. The bidding process involves multiple users competing for a product, with the highest bidder winning the item. As a result, each transaction is independent and characterized by varying transaction prices. The individual nature of auction items means that users cannot purchase identical items, adding to the uniqueness of the purchasing history. Bidders in auction systems rely on their judgment to determine the value of a product, as bidding prices reflect preferences rather than cost-free actions like clicking or collecting. Conventional methodologies that heavily rely on user-item purchase history are ill-suited to handle these unique and extreme product features. Unfortunately, prior recommendation approaches have failed to give due attention to the contextual intricacies of auction items, thereby missing out on the full potential of the invaluable bidding record at hand.This paper introduces a novel contrastive learning approach for auction recommendation, addressing the challenges of data sparsity and uniqueness in auction recommendation. Our method focuses on capturing multiple behavior relations and item context through contrastive pairs construction, contrastive embedding, and contrastive optimization techniques from both user and item perspectives. By overcoming the limitations of previous approaches, our method delivers promising results on two auction datasets, highlighting the practicality and effectiveness of our model.},

abstract = {Recommendation Systems (RS) have become an essential part of many online services. Due to its pivotal role in guiding customers towards purchasing, there is a natural motivation for unscrupulous parties to spoof RS for profits. In this paper, we study the shilling attack: a subsistent and profitable attack where an adversarial party injects a number of user profiles to promote or demote a target item. Conventional shilling attack models are based on simple heuristics that can be easily detected, or directly adopt adversarial attack methods without a special design for RS. Moreover, the study on the attack impact on deep learning based RS is missing in the literature, making the effects of shilling attack against real RS doubtful. We present a novel Augmented Shilling Attack framework (AUSH) and implement it with the idea of Generative Adversarial Network. AUSH is capable of tailoring attacks against RS according to budget and complex attack goals, such as targeting a specific user group. We experimentally show that the attack impact of AUSH is noticeable on a wide range of RS including both classic and modern deep learning based RS, while it is virtually undetectable by the state-of-the-art attack detection model.},

However, not all parts of the reviews are equally important, and the same choice of words may reflect a different meaning based on its context. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Aspect-based Neural Recommender (ANR) to perform aspect-based representation learning for both users and items via an attention-based component. Furthermore, we model the multi-faceted process behind how users rate items by estimating the aspect-level user and item importance by adapting the neural co-attention mechanism. Our proposed model concurrently address several shortcomings of existing recommender systems, and a thorough experimental study on 25 benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp shows that ANR significantly outperforms recently proposed state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCoNN, D-Attn and ALFM.},

One goal is to discover a set of aspects which are previously unknown for the domain, and predict the user's ratings on each aspect for each review. Another goal is to detect key terms for each aspect. Existing works on predicting aspect ratings fail to handle the aspect sparsity problem in the review texts leading to unreliable prediction. We propose a new generative model to tackle the latent aspect mining problem in an unsupervised manner. By considering the user and item side information of review texts, we introduce two latent variables, namely, user intrinsic aspect interest and item intrinsic aspect quality facilitating better modeling of aspect generation leading to improvement on the accuracy and reliability of predicted aspect ratings. Furthermore, we provide an analytical investigation on the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) optimization problem used in our proposed model and develop a new block coordinate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization with closed-form updating formulas. We also study its convergence analysis. Experimental results on the two real-world product review corpora demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.},

However, fake news dissemination has been greatly promoted via social media sites, and these fact-checking sites have not been fully utilized. To overcome these problems and complement existing methods against fake news, in this paper we propose a deep-learning based fact-checking URL recommender system to mitigate impact of fake news in social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. In particular, our proposed framework consists of a multi-relational attentive module and a heterogeneous graph attention network to learn complex/semantic relationship between user-URL pairs, user-user pairs, and URL-URL pairs. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that our proposed framework outperforms eight state-of-the-art recommendation models, achieving at least 3$sim$5.3% improvement.

abstract = {The popularity of e-commerce has promoted the rapid development of the logistics industry in recent years. As an important step in logistics, last-mile delivery from delivery stations to customers' addresses is now mainly finished by couriers, which requires accurate workload assessment based on actual efforts. However, the state-of-the-practice assessment methods neglect a vital factor that orders with the same customer's address (i.e., Homogeneous orders) can be delivered in a group (i.e., in a single trip) or separately (i.e., in multiple trips). It would cause unfair assessment among couriers if following the same rule. Thus, grouping homogeneous order accurately in the workload assessment is significant for achieving fair courier's workload assessment. To this end, we design, implement, and deploy a nationwide homogeneous order grouping system called FHOG for improving the accuracy of homogeneous order grouping in last-mile delivery for fair courier's workload assessment. FHOG utilizes the courier's reporting behavior for order inspection, collection, and delivery to identify homogeneous orders in the delivery station simultaneously for homogeneous order grouping. Compared with the state-of-the-practice method, our evaluation shows FHOG can effectively reduce order amounts with the higher and lower assessed courier's workload. We further deploy FHOG online in 8336 delivery stations to provide homogeneous order grouping service for more than 120 thousand couriers and 12 million daily orders. The results of the two surveys show that the couriers' acceptance rate is improved by 67% with FHOG after the promotion.},

abstract = {Recently, sequential recommendation has become a research hotspot while multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) that exploits users' heterogeneous interactions in sequences has received relatively little attention. Existing works often overlook the complementary effect of different perspectives when addressing the MBSR problem. In addition, there are two specific challenges remained to be addressed. One is the heterogeneity of a user's intention and the context information, the other one is the sparsity of the interactions of target behavior. To release the potential of multi-behavior interaction sequences, we propose a novel framework named NextIP that adopts a dual-task learning strategy to convert the problem to two specific tasks, i.e., &lt;u&gt;next&lt;/u&gt;-&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;tem prediction and &lt;u&gt;p&lt;/u&gt;urchase prediction. For next-item prediction, we design a target-behavior aware context aggregator (TBCG), which utilizes the next behavior to guide all kinds of behavior-specific item sub-sequences to jointly predict the next item. For purchase prediction, we design a behavior-aware self-attention (BSA) mechanism to extract a user's behavior-specific interests and treat them as negative samples to learn the user's purchase preferences. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets show that our NextIP performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper proposes a new ensemble learning framework, in which the local models and global models are synergetically updated from each other. This makes it possible to capture both local associations in user-item subgroups and global structures over all users and items.

abstract = {Most collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms only make use of the rating scores given by users for items. However, it is often the case that each rating score is associated with a piece of review text. Such review texts, which are capable of providing us valuable information to reveal the reasons why users give a certain rating, have not been exploited and they are usually ignored by most CF algorithms. Moreover, the underlying relationship buried in users and items has not been fully exploited. Items we would recommend can often be characterized into hidden groups (e.g. comedy, horror movie and action movie), and users can also be organized as hidden communities. We propose a new generative model to predict user's ratings on previously unrated items by considering review texts as well as hidden user communities and item groups relationship. Regarding the rating scores, traditional algorithms would not perform well on uncovering the community and group information of each user and each item since the user-item rating matrix is dyadic involving the mutual interactions between users and items. Instead, co-clustering, which is capable of conducting simultaneous clustering of two variables, is able to take advantage of such user-item relationships to better predict the rating scores. Additionally, co-clustering would be more effective for modeling the generation of review texts since different user communities would discuss different topics and vary their own wordings or expression patterns when dealing with different item groups. Besides, by modeling as a mixed membership over community and group respectively, each user or item can belong to multiple communities or groups with varying degrees. We have conducted extensive experiments to predict the missing rating scores on 22 real word datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.},

To model both of these information, which are essentially of different types, we propose a simple yet effective architecture which utilizes a 3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network which takes the word embeddings of the articles present in the user history as its input. Using such a method endows the model with the capability to automatically learn spatial (features of a particular article) as well as temporal features (features across articles read by a user) which signify the interest of the user. At test time, we use this in combination with a 2-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for recommending articles to users. On a real-world dataset our method outperformed strong baselines which also model the news recommendation problem using neural networks.},

abstract = {Most recommendation algorithms mainly make use of user history interactions in the model, while these methods often suffer from the cold-start problem (user/item has no history information). On the other sides, content features help on cold-start scenarios for modeling new users or items. So it is essential to utilize content features to enhance different recommendation models. To take full advantage of content features, feature interactions such as cross features are used by some models and outperform than using raw features. However, in real-world systems, many content features are incomplete, e.g., we may know the occupation and gender of a user, but the values of other features (location, interests, etc.) are missing. This missing-feature-value (MFV) problem is harmful to the model performance, especially for models that rely heavily on rich feature interactions. Unfortunately, this problem has not been well studied previously.In this work, we propose a new adaptive "Feature Sampling'' strategy to help train different models to fit distinct scenarios, no matter for cold-start or missing feature value cases. With the help of this strategy, more feature interactions can be utilized. A novel model named CC-CC is proposed. The model takes both raw features and the feature interactions into consideration. It has a linear part to memorize useful variant information from the user or item contents and contexts (Content &amp; Context Module), and a deep attentive neural module that models both content and collaborate information to enhance the generalization ability (Content &amp; Collaborate Module). Both parts have feature interactions. The model is evaluated on two public datasets. Comparative results show that the proposed CC-CC model outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on both warm and cold scenarios significantly (up to 6.3%). To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first clear and powerful model that proposed to handle the missing feature values problem in deep neural network frameworks for recommender systems.},

We also highlight several possible use cases and research questions that can benefit from the availability of user impressions in an open-source dataset. Furthermore, we release software tools to load and split the data, as well as examples of how to use both user interactions and impressions in several common recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Users usually play dual roles in real-world recommender systems. One is as a reviewer who writes reviews for items with rating scores, and the other is as a rater who rates the helpfulness scores of reviews. Traditional recommender systems mainly consider the reviewer role while not taking into account the rater role. However, the rater role allows users to express their opinions toward reviews about items; hence it may indirectly indicate their opinions about items, which could be complementary to the reviewer role. Since most real-world recommender systems provide convenient mechanisms for the rater role, recent studies show that typically there are much more helpfulness ratings from the rater role than item ratings from the reviewer role. Therefore, incorporating the rater role of users may have the potentials to mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start problems in traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit dual roles of users in recommender systems. In particular, we provide a principled way to exploit the rater role mathematically and propose a novel recommender system DualRec, which captures both the reviewer role and the rater role of users simultaneously for recommendation. Experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and further experiments are conducted to understand the importance of the rater role of users in recommendation.},

abstract = {Popular methods for news recommendation which are based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering have multiple drawbacks. The former method does not account for the sequential nature of news reading and suffers from the problem of cold-start, while the latter, suffers from over-specialization. In order to address these issues for news recommendation we propose a Hybrid Recurrent Attention Machine (HRAM). HRAM consists of two components. The first component utilizes a neural network for matrix factorization. While in the second component, we first learn the distributed representation of each news article. We then use the historical data of the user in a sequential manner and feed it to an attention-based recurrent layer. Finally, we concatenate the outputs from both these components and use further hidden layers in order to make predictions. In this way, we harness the information present in the user reading history and boost it with the information available through collaborative filtering for providing better news recommendations. Extensive experiments over two real-world datasets show that the proposed model provides significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of Internet applications, there are more and more entities in interaction scenarios, and thus collaborative prediction for multi-entity interaction is becoming a significant problem. The state-of-the-art methods, e.g., tensor factorization and factorization machine, predict multi-entity interaction based on calculating the similarity among all entities. However, these methods are usually not able to reveal the joint characteristics of entities in the interaction. Besides, some methods may succeed in one specific application, but they can not be extended effectively for other applications or interaction scenarios with more entities. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Representation (HIR) model, which models the mutual action among different entities as a joint representation. We generate the interaction representation of two entities via tensor multiplication, which is preformed iteratively to construct a hierarchical structure among all entities. Moreover, we employ several hidden layers to reveal the underlying properties of this interaction and enhance the model performance. After generating final representation, the prediction can be calculated using a variety of machine learning methods according to different tasks (i.e., linear regression for regression tasks, pair-wise ranking for ranking tasks and logistic regression for classification tasks). Experimental results show that our proposed HIR model yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods in four different application scenarios (i.e., general recommendation, context-aware recommendation, latent collaborative retrieval and click-through rate prediction).},

In such a setting, in addition to exploiting comments with high predicted ratings, it is also critical to explore comments with high uncertainty in the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm called LOGUCB that balances exploration with exploitation when the average rating of a comment is modeled using logistic regression on its features. At the core of our LOGUCB algorithm lies a novel variance approximation technique for the Bayesian logistic regression model that is used to compute the UCB value for each comment. In experiments with a real-life comments dataset from Yahoo! News, we show that LOGUCB with bag-of-words and topic features outperforms state-of-the-art explore-exploit algorithms.},

The herding introduces a popularity bias that may benefit affected users, but which comes at the expense of a normal user experience.

abstract = {User behavior sequences contain rich information about user interests and are exploited to predict user's future clicking in sequential recommendation. Existing approaches, especially recently proposed deep learning models, often embed a sequence of clicked items into a single vector, i.e., a point in vector space, which suffer from limited expressiveness for complex distributions of user interests with multi-modality and heterogeneous concentration. In this paper, we propose a new representation model, named as Seq2Bubbles, for sequential user behaviors via embedding an input sequence into a set of bubbles each of which is represented by a center vector and a radius vector in embedding space. The bubble embedding can effectively identify and accommodate multi-modal user interests and diverse concentration levels. Furthermore, we design an efficient scheme to compute distance between a target item and the bubble embedding of a user sequence to achieve next-item recommendation. We also develop a self-supervised contrastive loss based on our bubble embeddings as an effective regularization approach. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our bubble embedding can consistently outperform state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.},

abstract = {Sequential recommendation which aims to predict a user's next interaction based on his/her previous behaviors, has attracted great attention. Recent studies mainly employ deep recurrent neural networks or self-attention networks to capture dynamic user preferences. However, existing methods merely focus on modeling users' clear interests in interacted items. We argue that for an interaction, the user may also have ambiguous interests in items that are semantically related to the interacted one. For comprehensively capturing user preferences, it is beneficial to discover potential interests from historical interactions at a broader itemset level. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge graph enhanced sequential recommendation model namely KGIE, which focuses on enhancing user interest modeling with knowledge-enriched itemsets by incorporating the knowledge graph. Specifically, in addition to item-level interest modeling with interacted items, we further construct knowledge-enriched itemsets that are extracted via high-order knowledge associations with the interacted items. For capturing personalized itemset-level interests, we design an attentive aggregation unit to combine item embeddings considering both inherent and contextual personalization signals. Furthermore, to balance the contributions of both two levels of interest modeling, we adaptively learn high-level preference representations with a gating fusion unit. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance beyond state-of-the-art methods and recommendation interpretability of our model.},

abstract = {Large scale recommender models find most relevant items from huge catalogs, and they play a critical role in modern search and recommendation systems. To model the input space with large-vocab categorical features, a typical recommender model learns a joint embedding space through neural networks for both queries and items from user feedback data. However, with millions to billions of items in the corpus, users tend to provide feedback for a very small set of them, causing a power-law distribution. This makes the feedback data for long-tail items extremely sparse. Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised representation learning research in both computer vision and natural language understanding, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for large-scale item recommendations. The framework is designed to tackle the label sparsity problem by learning better latent relationship of item features. Specifically, SSL improves item representation learning as well as serving as additional regularization to improve generalization. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation method that utilizes feature correlations within the proposed framework.We evaluate our framework using two real-world datasets with 500M and 1B training examples respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSL regularization and show its superior performance over the state-of-the-art regularization techniques. We also have already launched the proposed techniques to a web-scale commercial app-to-app recommendation system, with significant improvements top-tier business metrics demonstrated in A/B experiments on live traffic. Our online results also verify our hypothesis that our framework indeed improves model performance even more on slices that lack supervision.},

abstract = {Nowadays, recommender systems provide essential web services on the Internet. There are mainly two categories of traditional recommendation algorithms: Content-Based (CB) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). CF methods make recommendations mainly according to the historical feedback information. They usually perform better when there is sufficient feedback information but less successful on new users and items, which is called the "cold-start'' problem. However, CB methods help in this scenario because of using content information. To take both advantages of CF and CB, how to combine them is a challenging issue. To the best of our knowledge, little previous work has been done to solve the problem in one unified recommendation model. In this work, we study how to integrate CF and CB, which utilizes both types of information in model-level but not in result-level and makes recommendations adaptively. A novel attention-based model named Attentional Content&amp;Collaborate Model (ACCM) is proposed. Attention mechanism helps adaptively adjust for each user-item pair from which source information the recommendation is made. Especially, a "cold sampling'' learning strategy is designed to handle the cold-start problem. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the ACCM performs better on both warm and cold tests compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are frequently used in domains in which users express their preferences in the form of graded judgments, such as ratings. Current ranking techniques are based on one of two sub-optimal approaches: either they optimize for a binary metric such as Average Precision, which discards information on relevance levels, or they optimize for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), which ignores the dependence of an item's contribution on the relevance of more highly ranked items. We address the shortcomings of existing approaches by proposing GAPfm, the Graded Average Precision factor model, which is a latent factor model for top-N recommendation in domains with graded relevance data. The model optimizes the Graded Average Precision metric that has been proposed recently for assessing the quality of ranked results lists for graded relevance. GAPfm's advantages are twofold: it maintains full information about graded relevance and also addresses the limitations of models that optimize NDCG. Experimental results show that GAPfm achieves substantial improvements on the top-N recommendation task, compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Personalized news recommendation aims to provide people with customized content, which can effectively improve the reading experience. Because user interests in news are diverse and changeable, how to learn accurate user representations is the core challenge in news recommendation. However, most of the previous works only apply news-level representation for user modeling directly, the views of news, such as title, abstract, and category, are only implied and compressed into a single vector of news, which makes it impossible for different views in different news to interact with each other. In this paper, we first focus on the view-level information for user modeling and propose Deep View-Temporal Interaction Network (DeepVT) for news recommendation. It mainly contains two components, i.e., 2D semi-causal convolutional neural network (SC-CNN) and multi-operator attention (MoA). SC-CNN can synthesize interaction information at the view-level and temporal information at the news-level simultaneously and efficiently. And MoA integrates different similarity operators in self-attention functions to avoid attention bias and enhance robustness. By collaboration with SC-CNN, the global interaction at the view-level becomes more sufficient. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, Microsoft News Dataset (MIND), show that our model outperforms previous models in terms of all metrics significantly.},

Our recommender system is an assistant to the sales team, helping recommend relevant apps to the customers for their businesses and increasing the likelihood of improving sales revenue. Besides recommendation accuracy, recommendation diversity and explainability are even more crucial since they provide more exposure opportunities for app developers and improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the recommender system. To allow the sales team to explore unpopular but relevant apps and understand why such apps are recommended, we propose a novel framework for improving aggregate recommendation diversity and generating recommendation explanations, which supports a wide variety of models for improving recommendation accuracy. The model in our framework is simple yet effective, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner and deployed as a recommendation service easily. Furthermore, our framework can also apply to other generic recommender systems for improving diversity and generating explanations.

abstract = {Query auto-completion (QAC) is a prominent feature of modern search engines. It is aimed at saving user's time and enhancing the search experience. Current QAC models mostly rank matching QAC candidates according to their past popularity, i.e., frequency. However, query popularity changes over time and may vary drastically across users. Hence, rankings of QAC candidates should be adjusted accordingly. In previous work time-sensitive QAC models and user-specific QAC models have been developed separately. Both types of QAC model lead to important improvements over models that are neither time-sensitive nor personalized. We propose a hybrid QAC model that considers both of these aspects: time-sensitivity and personalization.Using search logs, we return the top N QAC candidates by predicted popularity based on their recent trend and cyclic behavior. We use auto-correlation to detect query periodicity by long-term time-series analysis, and anticipate the query popularity trend based on observations within an optimal time window returned by a regression model. We rerank the returned top N candidates by integrating their similarities with a user's preceding queries (both in the current session and in previous sessions by the same user) on a character level to produce a final QAC list. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our hybrid QAC model outperforms state-of-the-art time-sensitive QAC baseline, achieving total improvements of between 3% and 7% in terms of MRR.},

abstract = {On-demand food delivery (OFD) platforms have greatly impacted the food service industry, where OFD recommendation systems play a central role in enhancing user experience and raising revenues. OFD recommendation, compared with existing online e-commerce recommendation systems, needs to put more emphasis on fulfillment time related variables, because the order fulfillment cycle time (OFCT) which refers to the time elapsed between a user placing a food order and receiving the food significantly influences a user's choice from the recommended items. In this paper, we investigate the OFCT related information and propose a Fulfillment-Time-Aware Personalized Ranking (FTAPR) method for recommendation. FTAPR mainly consists of three components. First, Transformers are used to estimate OFCT based on a large amount of user order sequences. Then, the predicted OFCT and other OFCT related features are fused and encoded by a deep &amp; cross network to learn fulfillment time related feature representation. At the last step, the time bias representation from the deep &amp; cross network is integrated into the ranking system to deliver final search results. Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets collected from one of China's largest OFD platforms Ele.me show the superiority of our model, e.g., an online A/B testing shows that FTAPR brings 1.3% and 2.5% gains in CTR and CVR compared with baselines.},

abstract = {Recently, convolutional neural networks(CNNs) has been demonstrated to effectively model reviews in recommender systems, due to the learning of contextual features such as surrounding words and word order for reviews. However, CNNs with max-pooling fails to capture the count information of contextual features, since the feature map generated by a convolution filter can only get a max feature value with max-pooling. If the max feature value appears more than once in the feature map, CNNs will lose the count information of the contextual feature. The count information is quite critical for modeling reviews, for example, ten "a good quality" is more credible than one "a good quality" for representing item properties, and five "the scenery is" shows that a user may pay more attention to the scenery than one "the scenery is" does. Our model, called WCN-MF, extends CNNs by introducing a new module named Deep Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DLDA) to capture the count information of contextual features. DLDA is inspired by the fact that contextual features consist of words, hence, we can first capture the count information of words, and second generate contextual features with words. By combining DLDA with CNNs, we can get a word-driven and context-aware review representation. Further, we incorporate the review representation with Matrix Factorization for recommendation. Our evaluations on three real- world datasets reveal that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation models.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, online forums have become primary news sources for readers around the globe, and social media platforms are the space where these news forums find most of their audience and engagement. Our particular focus in this paper is to study conflict dynamics over online news articles in Reddit, one of the most popular online discussion platforms. We choose to study how conflicts develop around news inside a discussion community, the em r/news subreddit. Mining the characteristics of these engagements often provide useful insights into the behavioral dynamics of large-scale human interactions. Such insights are useful for many reasons -- for news houses to improvise their publishing strategies and potential audience, for data analytics to get a better introspection over media engagement as well as for social media platforms to avoid unnecessary and perilous conflicts. In this work, we present a novel quantification of conflict in online discussion. Unlike previous studies on conflict dynamics, which model conflict as a binary phenomenon, our measure is continuous-valued, which we validate with manually annotated ratings. We address a two-way prediction task. Firstly, we predict the probable degree of conflict a news article will face from its audience. We employ multiple machine learning frameworks for this task using various features extracted from news articles.Secondly, given a pair of users and their interaction history, we predict if their future engagement will result in a conflict. We fuse textual and network-based features together using a support vector machine which achieves an AUC of 0.89. Moreover, we implement a graph convolutional model which exploits engagement histories of users to predict whether a pair of users who never met each other before will have a conflicting interaction, with an AUC of 0.69. We perform our studies on a massive discussion dataset crawled from the Reddit news community, containing over $41k$ news articles and $5.5$ million comments. Apart from the prediction tasks, our studies offer interesting insights on the conflict dynamics -- how users form clusters based on conflicting engagements, how different is the temporal nature of conflict over different online news forums, how is contribution of different language based features to induce conflict, etc. In short, our study paves the way towards new methods of exploration and modeling of conflict dynamics inside online discussion communities.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have achieved big success in various domains such as image generation, music generation, and natural language generation. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based collaborative filtering (CF) framework to provide higher accuracy in recommendation. We first identify a fundamental problem of existing GAN-based methods in CF and highlight it quantitatively via a series of experiments. Next, we suggest a new direction of vector-wise adversarial training to solve the problem and propose our GAN-based CF framework, called CFGAN, based on the direction. We identify a unique challenge that arises when vector-wise adversarial training is employed in CF. We then propose three CF methods realized on top of our CFGAN that are able to address the challenge. Finally, via extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we validate that vector-wise adversarial training employed in CFGAN is really effective to solve the problem of existing GAN-based CF methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed CF methods on CFGAN provide recommendation accuracy consistently and universally higher than those of the state-of-the-art recommenders.},

Nevertheless, the evaluation of recommender systems is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for evaluating recommender systems, which is multidimensional and takes into account for the multiple facets of the recommendation algorithms, data sets and performance measures. Emphasis is placed on supporting business applications of recommender systems, notably e-commerce, by allowing analysts to perform ad-hoc analysis and use popular online analytical processing (OLAP) operations. Combined with support for visual analysis, action such as drill-down or slice/dice allow assessment of the performance of recommendations in terms of business objectives. We describe a detailed methodology for designing and developing the proposed multidimensional framework, and provide insights about its applications. Our experimental results, using a research prototype, demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to comprise an effective way for evaluating recommender systems.},

abstract = {Media seems to have become more partisan, often providing a biased coverage of news catering to the interest of specific groups. It is therefore essential to identify credible information content that provides an objective narrative of an event. News communities such as digg, reddit, or newstrust offer recommendations, reviews, quality ratings, and further insights on journalistic works. However, there is a complex interaction between different factors in such online communities: fairness and style of reporting, language clarity and objectivity, topical perspectives (like political viewpoint), expertise and bias of community members, and more.This paper presents a model to systematically analyze the different interactions in a news community between users, news, and sources. We develop a probabilistic graphical model that leverages this joint interaction to identify 1) highly credible news articles, 2) trustworthy news sources, and 3) expert users who perform the role of "citizen journalists" in the community. Our method extends CRF models to incorporate real-valued ratings, as some communities have very fine-grained scales that cannot be easily discretized without losing information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first full-fledged analysis of credibility, trust, and expertise in news communities.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) algorithms have played a major role in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various learning applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems (RSs). However, these methods are based on a vast amount of data and do not perform as well when there is a limited amount of data available. Moreover, some of these applications (e.g., RSs) suffer from other issues such as data sparsity and the cold-start problem. While recent research on RSs used DL models based on side information (SI) (e.g., product reviews, film plots, etc.) to tackle these challenges, we propose boosting neural network (BNN), a new DL framework for capturing complex patterns, which requires just a limited amount of data. Unlike conventional boosting, BNN does not sum the predictions generated by its components. Instead, it uses these predictions as new SI features which enhances accuracy. Our framework can be utilized for many problems, including classification, regression, and ranking. In this paper, we demonstrate BNN's use for addressing a classification task. Comprehensive experiments conducted to illustrate BNN's effectiveness on three real-world datasets demonstrated its ability to outperform existing SOTA models for classification tasks (e.g., clickthrough rate prediction).},

One of the greatest challenges collaborative filtering systems are confronted with is the data sparsity problem: users typically rate only very few items; thus, availability of historical data is not adequate to effectively perform prediction. To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel multitask collaborative filtering approach. Our approach is based on a coupled latent factor model of the users rating functions, which allows for coming up with an agile information sharing mechanism that extracts much richer task-correlation information compared to existing approaches. Formulation of our method is based on concepts from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics, specifically Indian Buffet Process priors, which allow for data-driven determination of the optimal number of underlying latent features (item characteristics and user traits) assumed in the context of the model. We experiment on several real-world datasets, demonstrating both the efficacy of our method, and its superiority over existing approaches.},

abstract = {Most existing recommender systems can be classified into two categories: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Hybrid recommender systems combine the advantages of the two for improved recommendation performance. Traditional recommender systems are rating-based. However, predicting ratings is an intermediate step towards their ultimate goal of generating rankings or recommendation lists. Learning to rank is an established means of predicting rankings and has recently demonstrated high promise in improving quality of recommendations. In this paper, we propose LRHR, the first attempt that adapts learning to rank to hybrid recommender systems. LRHR first defines novel representations for both users and items so that they can be content-comparable. Then, LRHR identifies a set of novel meta-level features for learning purposes. Finally, LRHR adopts RankSVM, a pairwise learning to rank algorithm, to generate recommendation lists of items for users. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the performance gain of our approach.},

Existing work on tip generation does not take query into consideration, which limits the impact of tips in search scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a query-aware tip generation framework, integrating query information into encoding and subsequent decoding processes. Two specific adaptations of Transformer and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are proposed. For Transformer, the query impact is incorporated into the self-attention computation of both the encoder and the decoder. As for RNN, the query-aware encoder adopts a selective network to distill query-relevant information from the review, while the query-aware decoder integrates the query information into the attention computation during decoding. The framework consistently outperforms the competing methods on both public and real-world industrial datasets. Last but not least, online deployment experiments on Dianping demonstrate the advantage of the proposed framework for tip generation as well as its online business values.},

abstract = {User feedback in the form of movie-watching history, item ratings, or product consumption is very helpful in training recommender systems. However, relatively few interactions between items and users can be observed. Instances of missing user--item entries are caused by the user not seeing the item (although the actual preference to the item could still be positive) or the user seeing the item but not liking it. Separating these two cases enables missing interactions to be modeled with finer granularity, and thus reflects user preferences more accurately. However, most previous studies on the modeling of missing instances have not fully considered the case where the user has not seen the item. Social connections are known to be helpful for modeling users' potential preferences more extensively, although a similar visibility problem exists in accurately identifying social relationships. That is, when two users are unaware of each other's existence, they have no opportunity to connect. In this paper, we propose a novel user preference model for recommender systems that considers the visibility of both items and social relationships. Furthermore, the two kinds of information are coordinated in a unified model inspired by the idea of transfer learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world datasets in comparison with five state-of-the-art approaches. The encouraging performance of the proposed system verifies the effectiveness of social knowledge transfer and the modeling of both item and social visibilities.},

abstract = {As a well-established probabilistic method, topic models seek to uncover latent semantics from plain text. In addition to having textual content, we observe that documents are usually compared in listwise rankings based on their content. For instance, world-wide countries are compared in an international ranking in terms of electricity production based on their national reports. Such document comparisons constitute additional information that reveal documents' relative similarities. Incorporating them into topic modeling could yield comparative topics that help to differentiate and rank documents. Furthermore, based on different comparison criteria, the observed document comparisons usually cover multiple aspects, each expressing a distinct ranked list. For example, a country may be ranked higher in terms of electricity production, but fall behind others in terms of life expectancy or government budget. Each comparison criterion, or aspect, observes a distinct ranking. Considering such multiple aspects of comparisons based on different ranking criteria allows us to derive one set of topics that inform heterogeneous document similarities. We propose a generative topic model aimed at learning topics that are well aligned to multi-aspect listwise comparisons. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in jointly modeling topics and ranked lists against baselines comprehensively.},

However, the concerns about how to standardize open source implementation of recommendation algorithms continually increase in the research community. In the light of this challenge, we propose a unified, comprehensive and efficient recommender system library called RecBole (pronounced as [rEk'boUl@r]), which provides a unified framework to develop and reproduce recommendation algorithms for research purpose. In this library, we implement 73 recommendation models on 28 benchmark datasets, covering the categories of general recommendation, sequential recommendation, context-aware recommendation and knowledge-based recommendation. We implement the RecBole library based on PyTorch, which is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. Our library is featured in many aspects, including general and extensible data structures, comprehensive benchmark models and datasets, efficient GPU-accelerated execution, and extensive and standard evaluation protocols. We provide a series of auxiliary functions, tools, and scripts to facilitate the use of this library, such as automatic parameter tuning and break-point resume. Such a framework is useful to standardize the implementation and evaluation of recommender systems. The project and documents are released at https://recbole.io/.},

abstract = {The incorporation of contextual information is an important part of context-aware recommendation. Many context-aware recommendation systems adopt tensor completion to include contextual information. However, the symmetries between dimensions of a tensor induce an unreasonable assumption that users, items and contexts should be treated equally in recommender systems. In this paper, we address this by using matrices over finite abelian group algebra (AGA) to model context-aware interactions between users and items. Specifically, we formulate context-aware recommendation as a low-rank matrix completion problem over AGA (MC-AGA) and derive a new algorithm using the inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier method. We then test MC-AGA on two real-world datasets: one containing implicit feedback and one with explicit feedback.

abstract = {Previous work studied one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) problems including pointwise methods, pairwise methods, and content-based methods. The fundamental assumptions made on these approaches are roughly the same. They regard all missing values as negative. However, this is unreasonable since the missing values actually are the mixture of negative and positive examples. A user does not give a positive feedback on an item probably only because she/he is unaware of the item, but in fact, she/he is fond of it. Furthermore, content-based methods, e.g. collaborative topic regression (CTR), usually require textual content information of items. This cannot be satisfied in some cases. In this paper, we exploit latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on OCCF problem. It assumes missing values unknown and only models the observed data, and it also does not need content information of items. In our model items are regarded as words and users are considered as documents and the user-item feedback matrix denotes the corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous methods on various ranking-oriented evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Product search and recommendation is a task that every e-commerce platform wants to outperform their peels on. However, training a good search or recommendation model often requires more data than what many platforms have. Fortunately, the search tasks on different platforms share the common underlying structure. Considering each platform as a domain, we propose a cross-domain learning approach to help the task on data-deficient platforms by leveraging the data from data-abundant platforms. In our solution, the importance of features in different domains is addressed by a domain-specific attention network. Meanwhile, a multi-task regularizer based on Wasserstein distance is introduced to help extract both domain-invariant and domain-specific features. Our model consistently outperforms the competing methods on both public and real-world industry datasets. Quantitative evaluation shows that our model can discover important features for different domains, which helps us better understand different user needs across platforms. Last but not least, we have deployed our model online in three big e-commerce platforms namely Taobao, Tmall, and Qintao, and observed better performance than the production models for all the platforms.},

abstract = {To improve user experience and profits of corporations, modern industrial recommender systems usually aim to select the items that are most likely to be interacted with (e.g., clicks and purchases). However, they overlook the fact that users may purchase the items even without recommendations. The real effective items are the ones that can contribute to purchase probability uplift. To select these effective items, it is essential to estimate the causal effect of recommendations. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain the real causal effect since we can only recommend or not recommend an item to a user at one time. Furthermore, previous works usually rely on the randomized controlled trial (RCT) experiment to evaluate their performance. However, it is usually not practicable in the recommendation scenario due to its expensive experimental cost. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a causal collaborative filtering (CausCF) method inspired by the widely adopted collaborative filtering (CF) technique. It is based on the idea that similar users not only have a similar taste on items but also have similar treatment effects under recommendations. CausCF extends the classical matrix factorization to the tensor factorization with three dimensions---user, item, and treatment. Furthermore, we also employ regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate the precision of the estimated causal effects from different models. With the testable assumptions, RDD analysis can provide an unbiased causal conclusion without RCT experiments. Through dedicated experiments on both offline and online experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CausCF on the causal effect estimation and ranking performance improvement.},

In practice, this query model poses new challenges for effectiveness and efficiency in online search, even when a complete query is given as input in one keystroke. This is mainly because it requires a joint exploration of the social space and classic IR indexes such as inverted lists. We describe a memory-efficient and incremental prefix-based retrieval algorithm, which also exhibits an anytime behavior, allowing to output the most likely answer within any chosen running-time limit. We evaluate it through extensive experiments for several applications and search scenarios, including searching for posts in micro-blogging (Twitter and Tumblr), as well as searching for businesses based on reviews in Yelp.

However, similar to traditional latent factor models by factorizing user-item interactions, they tend to be ineffective to capture localized information. Localized information, such as neighborhood, is important to recommender systems in complementing the user-item interaction data. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel Neighborhood-based Neural Collaborative Filtering model (NNCF). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the neighborhood information is integrated into the neural collaborative filtering methods.

abstract = {An industrial recommender system generally presents a hybrid list that contains results from multiple subsystems. In practice, each subsystem is optimized with its own feedback data to avoid the disturbance among different subsystems. However, we argue that such data usage may lead to sub-optimal online performance because of thedata sparsity. To alleviate this issue, we propose to extract knowledge from thesuper-domain that contains web-scale and long-time impression data, and further assist the online recommendation task (downstream task). To this end, we propose a novel industrial KnowlEdge Extraction and Plugging (KEEP) framework, which is a two-stage framework that consists of 1) a supervised pre-training knowledge extraction module on super-domain, and 2) a plug-in network that incorporates the extracted knowledge into the downstream model. This makes it friendly for incremental training of online recommendation. Moreover, we design an efficient empirical approach for KEEP and introduce our hands-on experience during the implementation of KEEP in a large-scale industrial system. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that KEEP can achieve promising results. It is notable that KEEP has also been deployed on the display advertising system in Alibaba, bringing a lift of +5.4% CTR and +4.7% RPM.},

To this end, we collect and release XMarket, a large dataset covering 18 local markets on 16 different product categories, featuring 52.5 million user-item interactions.  We introduce and formalize the problem of cross-market product recommendation, i.e., market adaptation. We explore different market-adaptation techniques inspired by state-of-the-art domain-adaptation and meta-learning approaches and propose a novel neural approach for market adaptation, named FOREC. Our model follows a three-step procedure - pre-training, forking, and fine-tuning - in order to fully utilize the data from an auxiliary market as well as the target market. We conduct extensive experiments studying the impact of market adaptation on different pairs of markets. Our proposed approach demonstrates robust effectiveness, consistently improving the performance on target markets compared to competitive baselines selected for our analysis. In particular, FOREC improves on average 24% and up to 50% in terms of nDCG@10, compared to the NMF baseline. Our analysis and experiments suggest specific future directions in this research area.

abstract = {Information diffusion prediction targets on forecasting how information items spread among a set of users. Recently, neural networks have been widely used in modeling information diffusion, owing to the great successes of deep learning. However, in real-world information diffusion scenarios, users are likely to have different behaviors to information items from different topics. Existing neural-based methods failed to model the topic-specific diffusion patterns and dependencies, which have been shown to be useful in conventional non-neural methods. In this paper, we propose Topic-aware Attention Network (TAN) to take advantage of both topic-specific diffusion modeling and deep learning techniques. We jointly model the text content of information items and cascade sequences by incorporating topical context and user/position dependencies into user representations via attention mechanisms. A time-decayed aggregation module is further employed to integrate user representations for cascade representations, which can encode the topic-specific diffusion dependencies independently. Experimental results on diffusion prediction tasks over three realistic cascade datasets show that our model can achieve a relative improvement up to 9% against the best performing baseline in terms of Hits@10.},

Our proposed method models item content via a topic model, and user communities via an autoencoder model, while bridging a user's community-based preference to her topic-based preference.

Because of inherent data sparsity, it remains a challenging problem for deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new CF model, namely the imputation-boosted denoising autoencoder (IDAE), for top-N recommendation. Specifically, IDAE consists of two steps: imputing positive values and learning with imputed values. First, it infers and imputes positive user feedback from missing values. Then, the correlation between items is learned by using the denoising autoencoder (DAE) with imputed values. Unlike the existing DAE that randomly corrupts the input, the key characteristic of IDAE is that original user values are taken as the input, and imputed values are reflected as the corrupted output. Our experimental results demonstrate that IDAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CF algorithms using autoencoders (by up to 5%) on the MovieLens datasets.},

Rapid profiling of new users is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories.

abstract = {Heterogeneous information network has been widely used to alleviate sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems since it can model rich context information in user-item interactions. Graph neural network is able to encode this rich context information through propagation on the graph. However, existing heterogeneous graph neural networks neglect entanglement of the latent factors stemming from different aspects. Moreover, meta paths in existing approaches are simplified as connecting paths or side information between node pairs, overlooking the rich semantic information in the paths. In this paper, we propose a novel disentangled heterogeneous graph attention network DisenHAN for top-N recommendation, which learns disentangled user/item representations from different aspects in a heterogeneous information network. In particular, we use meta relations to decompose high-order connectivity between node pairs and propose a disentangled embedding propagation layer which can iteratively identify the major aspect of meta relations. Our model aggregates corresponding aspect features from each meta relation for the target user/item. With different layers of embedding propagation, DisenHAN is able to explicitly capture the collaborative filtering effect semantically. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that DisenHAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the learned disentangled representations via insightful case studies and visualization.},

The first tier improves recipe text embedding by optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced sequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the ResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with word2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint embedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin optimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of cross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further reduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific embedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the image category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint embedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the visual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint embedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark dataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and recipe-to-image retrievals.},

abstract = {Tag-aware recommender systems (TRS) utilize rich tagging records to better depict user portraits and item features. Recently, many efforts have been done to improve TRS with neural networks. However, these solutions rustically rely on the tag-based features for recommendation, which is insufficient to ease the sparsity, ambiguity and redundancy issues introduced by tags, thus hindering the recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel tag-aware recommendation model named Tag Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN), which leverages the contextual semantics of multi-hop neighbors in the user-tag-item graph to alleviate the above issues. Specifically, TGCN first employs type-aware neighbor sampling and aggregation operation to learn the type-specific neighborhood representations. Then we leverage attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of different node types and creatively employ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as type-level aggregator to perform vertical and horizontal convolutions for modeling multi-granular feature interactions. Besides, a TransTag regularization function is proposed to accurately identify user's substantive preference. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and a real industrial dataset show that TGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for tag-aware top-N recommendation.},

abstract = {Product-related question answering (QA) is an important but challenging task in E-Commerce. It leads to a great demand on automatic review-driven QA, which aims at providing instant responses towards user-posted questions based on diverse product reviews. Nevertheless, the rich information about personal opinions in product reviews, which is essential to answer those product-specific questions, is underutilized in current generation-based review-driven QA studies. There are two main challenges when exploiting the opinion information from the reviews to facilitate the opinion-aware answer generation: (i) jointly modeling opinionated and interrelated information between the question and reviews to capture important information for answer generation, (ii) aggregating diverse opinion information to uncover the common opinion towards the given question. In this paper, we tackle opinion-aware answer generation by jointly learning answer generation and opinion mining tasks with a unified model. Two kinds of opinion fusion strategies, namely, static and dynamic fusion, are proposed to distill and aggregate important opinion information learned from the opinion mining task into the answer generation process. Then a multi-view pointer-generator network is employed to generate opinion-aware answers for a given product-related question. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance in real-world E-Commerce QA datasets, and effectively generate opinionated and informative answers.},

However, little research work has been reported on utilizing the implicit "social" factors (i.e., the potential influential experts in news reading community) among news readers to facilitate news personalization. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of integrating content-based methods, collaborative filtering and information diffusion models by employing probabilistic matrix factorization techniques. We propose PRemiSE, a novel Personalized news Recommendation framework via implicit Social Experts, in which the opinions of potential influencers on virtual social networks extracted from implicit feedbacks are treated as auxiliary resources for recommendation. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our method, particularly, on handling the so-called cold-start problem.},

We identify that thread content and user interests can be categorized in two dimensions: topics and concepts. CLIR leverages Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to summarize the topic dimension and uses Convolutional Neural Network to encode the concept dimension. It then builds a thread neural network to capture thread characteristics and builds a user neural network to capture user interests by integrating these two dimensions and their interactions. Finally, it matches the target thread's characteristics with candidate users' interests to make recommendations. Experimental evaluation with multiple OHC datasets demonstrates the performance advantage of CLIR over the state-of-the-art recommender systems on various evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Most of the current recommender systems heavily rely on explicit user feedback such as ratings on items to model users' interests. However, in many applications, it is very hard to collect the explicit feedback, while implicit feedback such as user clicks may be more available. Furthermore, it is often more suitable for many recommender systems to address a ranking problem than a rating predicting problem. This paper proposes a latent pairwise preference learning (LPPL) approach for recommendation with implicit feedback. LPPL directly models user preferences with respect to a set of items rather than the rating scores on individual items, which are modeled with a set of features by analyzing clickthrough data available in many real-world recommender systems. The LPPL approach models both the latent variables of group structure of users and the pairwise preferences simultaneously. We conduct experiments on the testbed from a real-world recommender system and demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve the recommendation performance against several baseline algorithms.},

However, in existing recommender systems, the information about latent user interests are largely under-explored. To that end, in this paper, we propose an interest expansion strategy via personalized ranking based on the topic model, named iExpand, for building an interest-oriented collaborative filtering framework. The iExpand method introduces a three-layer, user-interest-item, representation scheme, which leads to more interpretable recommendation results and helps the understanding of the interactions among users, items, and user interests. Moreover, iExpand strategically deals with many issues, such as the overspecialization and the cold-start problems. Finally, we evaluate iExpand on benchmark data sets, and experimental results show that iExpand outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

We then use a novel degree-specialty weighting scheme resembling TF-IDF to weight the terms.

abstract = {Recent research explores incorporating knowledge graphs (KG) into e-commerce recommender systems, not only to achieve better recommendation performance, but more importantly to generate explanations of why particular decisions are made. This can be achieved by explicit KG reasoning, where a model starts from a user node, sequentially determines the next step, and walks towards an item node of potential interest to the user. However, this is challenging due to the huge search space, unknown destination, and sparse signals over the KG, so informative and effective guidance is needed to achieve a satisfactory recommendation quality. To this end, we propose a CoArse-to-FinE neural symbolic reasoning approach (CAFE). It first generates user profiles as coarse sketches of user behaviors, which subsequently guide a path-finding process to derive reasoning paths for recommendations as fine-grained predictions. User profiles can capture prominent user behaviors from the history, and provide valuable signals about which kinds of path patterns are more likely to lead to potential items of interest for the user. To better exploit the user profiles, an improved path-finding algorithm called Profile-guided Path Reasoning (PPR) is also developed, which leverages an inventory of neural symbolic reasoning modules to effectively and efficiently find a batch of paths over a large-scale KG. We extensively experiment on four real-world benchmarks and observe substantial gains in the recommendation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In order to address the data sparsity problem in recommender systems, in recent years, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) leverages the relatively richer information from a source domain to improve the recommendation performance on a target domain with sparser information. However, each of the two domains may be relatively richer in certain types of information (e.g., ratings, reviews, user profiles, item details, and tags), and thus, if we can leverage such information well, it is possible to improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously (i.e., dual-target CDR), rather than a single target domain only. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, DTCDR, for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation. In DTCDR, we first extensively utilize rating and multi-source content information to generate rating and document embeddings of users and items. Then, based on Multi-Task Learning (MTL), we design an adaptable embedding-sharing strategy to combine and share the embeddings of common users across domains, with which DTCDR can improve the recommendation performance on both richer and sparser (i.e., dual-target) domains simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that DTCDR can significantly improve the recommendation accuracies on both richer and sparser domains and outperform the state-of-the-art single-domain and cross-domain approaches.},

Its topic layers allow TCM to capture not only word co-occurrence patterns in each theme, but also word co-occurrence patterns at any given time in each theme as trends. Experiments on various data sets show that the proposed model is useful as a generative model to discover fine-grained tightly coherent topics, takes advantage of previous models, and then assigns values for new documents.},

Cross-domain recommenders address the sparsity problem by using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to transfer knowledge from a dense domain into a sparse target domain. In this paper we propose a transfer learning technique that extracts knowledge from multiple domains containing rich data (e.g., movies and music) and generates recommendations for a sparse target domain (e.g., games). Our method learns the relatedness between the different source domains and the target domain, without requiring overlapping users between domains. The model integrates the appropriate amount of knowledge from each domain in order to enrich the target domain data. Experiments with several datasets reveal that, using multiple sources and the relatedness between domains improves accuracy of results.},

abstract = {Feature-based collaborative filtering models, such as state-of-the-art factorization machines and regression-based latent factor models, rarely consider features' structural information, ignoring the heterogeneity of inter-type and intra-type relationships. Na\"{\i}vely treating all feature pairs equally would potentially deteriorate the overall recommendation performance. In addition, human prior knowledge and other hierarchical or graphical structures are often available for some features, e.g., the country-state-city hierarchy for geographic features and the topical taxonomy for article features. It is a challenge to utilize the prior knowledge to further boost performance of state-of-the-art models. In this paper we employ rich features from both user and item sides to enhance latent factors learnt from interaction data, uncovering hidden structures from features' relationships and learning sparse pairwise and tree structural connections among features. Our framework borrows the modeling strengh from both structural sparsity modeling and latent factor models. Experiments on a real-world large-scale recommendation data set demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms several strong state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Hashtags, a user provides to a micro-video, are the ones which can well describe the semantics of the micro-video's content in his/her mind. At the same time, hashtags have been widely used to facilitate various micro-video retrieval scenarios (e.g., search, browse, and categorization). Despite their importance, numerous micro-videos lack hashtags or contain inaccurate or incomplete hashtags. In light of this, hashtag recommendation, which suggests a list of hashtags to a user when he/she wants to annotate a post, becomes a crucial research problem. However, little attention has been paid to micro-video hashtag recommendation, mainly due to the following three reasons: 1) lack of benchmark dataset; 2) the temporal and multi-modality characteristics of micro-videos; and 3) hashtag sparsity and long-tail distributions. In this paper, we recommend hashtags for micro-videos by presenting a novel multi-view representation interactive embedding model with graph-based information propagation. It is capable of boosting the performance of micro-videos hashtag recommendation by jointly considering the sequential feature learning, the video-user-hashtag interaction, and the hashtag correlations. Extensive experiments on a constructed dataset demonstrate our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. As a side research contribution, we have released our dataset and codes to facilitate the research in this community.},

Examples include lists of books on Goodreads, playlists on Spotify and YouTube, collections of images on Pinterest, and lists of answers on question-answer sites like Zhihu. Recommending item lists is critical for increasing user engagement and connecting users to new items, but many approaches are designed for the item-based recommendation, without careful consideration of the complex relationships between items and lists. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel user-generated list recommendation model called AttList. Two unique features of AttList are careful modeling of (i) hierarchical user preference, which aggregates items to characterize the list that they belong to, and then aggregates these lists to estimate the user preference, naturally fitting into the hierarchical structure of item lists; and (ii) item and list consistency, through a novel self-attentive aggregation layer designed for capturing the consistency of neighboring items and lists to better model user preference. Through experiments over three real-world datasets reflecting different kinds of user-generated item lists, we find that AttList results in significant improvements in NDCG, Precision@k, and Recall@k versus a suite of state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, all code and data are available at https://github.com/heyunh2015/AttList.},

abstract = {Providing accurate recommendations to newly joined users (or potential users, so-called cold-start users) has remained a challenging yet important problem in recommender systems. To infer the preferences of such cold-start users based on their preferences observed in other domains, several cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods have been studied. The state-of-the-art Embedding and Mapping approach for CDR (EMCDR) aims to infer the latent vectors of cold-start users by supervised mapping from the latent space of another domain. In this paper, we propose a novel CDR framework based on semi-supervised mapping, called SSCDR, which effectively learns the cross-domain relationship even in the case that only a few number of labeled data is available. To this end, it first learns the latent vectors of users and items for each domain so that their interactions are represented by the distances, then trains a cross-domain mapping function to encode such distance information by exploiting both overlapping users as labeled data and all the items as unlabeled data. In addition, SSCDR adopts an effective inference technique that predicts the latent vectors of cold-start users by aggregating their neighborhood information. Our extensive experiments on different CDR scenarios show that SSCDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of CDR accuracy, particularly in the realistic settings that a small portion of users overlap between two domains.},

abstract = {With over 34 billion IoT devices to be installed by 2020, the Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally changing our lives. One of the greatest benefits of the IoT is the powerful automations achieved by applying rules to IoT devices. For instance, a rule named "Make me a cup of coffee when I wake up'' automatically turns on the coffee machine when the sensor in the bedroom detects motion in the morning. With large numbers of possible rules out there, a recommendation system is of great necessity to help users find rules they need. However, little effort has been made to design a model tailored for the IoT rule recommendation, which comes with lots of new challenges compared with traditional recommendation tasks. We not only need to re-define "users'' and "items'' in the recommendation task, but also have to consider a new type of entities, devices, and the extra information and constraints brought by them. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel efficient recommendation algorithm, which not only considers the implicit feedback of users on rules, but also takes user-rule-device interactions and the match between rule device requirements and user device possessions into account. In collaboration with Samsung, one of the leading companies in this field, we have designed an IoT rule recommendation framework and evaluated our algorithm on a real-life industry dataset. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

abstract = {Users' consumption behaviors are affected by both their personal preference and their exposure to items (i.e. whether a user knows the items).Most of the recent works in social recommendation assume that people share similar preference with their socially connected friends. However, this assumption may not hold due to the diversity of social relations, and modeling social influence on users' preference may not be suitable for implicit feedback data (i.e. whether a user has consumed certain items). Since users often share item information with their social relations, it will be less restrictive to model social influence on users' exposure to items. We notice that a user's exposure is affected by the exposure of the other users in his social communities and by the consumption of his connected friends. In this paper, we propose a novel social exposure-based recommendation model SoEXBMF by integrating two kinds of social influence on users' exposure, i.e. social knowledge influence and social consumption influence, into basic EXMF model for better recommendation performance. Furthermore, SoEXBMF uses Bernoulli distribution instead of Gaussian distribution in EXMF to better model the binary implicit feedback data. A variational inference method has been developed for the proposed SoEXBMF model to infer the posterior and make the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods in various evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Geographical characteristics derived from the historical check-in data have been reported effective in improving location recommendation accuracy. However, previous studies mainly exploit geographical characteristics from a user's perspective, via modeling the geographical distribution of each individual user's check-ins. In this paper, we are interested in exploiting geographical characteristics from a location perspective, by modeling the geographical neighborhood of a location. The neighborhood is modeled at two levels: the instance-level neighborhood defined by a few nearest neighbors of the location, and the region-level neighborhood for the geographical region where the location exists. We propose a novel recommendation approach, namely Instance-Region Neighborhood Matrix Factorization (IRenMF), which exploits two levels of geographical neighborhood characteristics: a) instance-level characteristics, i.e., nearest neighboring locations tend to share more similar user preferences; and b) region-level characteristics, i.e., locations in the same geographical region may share similar user preferences. In IRenMF, the two levels of geographical characteristics are naturally incorporated into the learning of latent features of users and locations, so that IRenMF predicts users' preferences on locations more accurately. Extensive experiments on the real data collected from Gowalla, a popular LBSN, demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach.},

abstract = {Generating the Top-N recommendations from a large corpus is computationally expensive to perform at scale. Candidate generation and re-ranking based approaches are often adopted in industrial settings to alleviate efficiency problems. However it remains to be fully studied how well such schemes approximate complete rankings (or how many candidates are required to achieve a good approximation), or to develop systematic approaches to generate high-quality candidates efficiently. In this paper, we seek to investigate these questions via proposing a candidate generation and re-ranking based framework (CIGAR), which first learns a preference-preserving binary embedding for building a hash table to retrieve candidates, and then learns to re-rank the candidates using real-valued ranking models with a candidate-oriented objective. We perform a comprehensive study on several large-scale real-world datasets consisting of millions of users/items and hundreds of millions of interactions. Our results show that CIGAR significantly boosts the Top-N accuracy against state-of-the-art recommendation models, while reducing the query time by orders of magnitude. We hope that this work could draw more attention to the candidate generation problem in recommender systems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are aimed at generating a personalized ranked list of items that an end user might be interested in. With the unprecedented success of deep learning in computer vision and speech recognition, recently it has been a hot topic to bridge the gap between recommender systems and deep neural network. And deep learning methods have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art on many recommendation tasks. For example, a recent model, NeuMF, first projects users and items into some shared low-dimensional latent feature space, and then employs neural nets to model the interaction between the user and item latent features to obtain state-of-the-art performance on the recommendation tasks. NeuMF assumes that the non-interacted items are inherent negative and uses negative sampling to relax this assumption. In this paper, we examine an alternative approach which does not assume that the non-interacted items are necessarily negative, just that they are less preferred than interacted items. Specifically, we develop a new classification strategy based on the widely used pairwise ranking assumption. We combine our classification strategy with the recently proposed neural collaborative filtering framework, and propose a general collaborative ranking framework called Neural Network based Collaborative Ranking (NCR). We resort to a neural network architecture to model a user's pairwise preference between items, with the belief that neural network will effectively capture the latent structure of latent factors. The experimental results on two real-world datasets show the superior performance of our models in comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Conversational search and recommendation based on user-system dialogs exhibit major differences from conventional search and recommendation tasks in that 1) the user and system can interact for multiple semantically coherent rounds on a task through natural language dialog, and 2) it becomes possible for the system to understand the user needs or to help users clarify their needs by asking appropriate questions from the users directly. We believe the ability to ask questions so as to actively clarify the user needs is one of the most important advantages of conversational search and recommendation. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a unified conversational search/recommendation framework, in an attempt to make the research problem doable under a standard formalization. Specifically, we propose a System Ask -- User Respond (SAUR) paradigm for conversational search, define the major components of the paradigm, and design a unified implementation of the framework for product search and recommendation in e-commerce. To accomplish this, we propose the Multi-Memory Network (MMN) architecture, which can be trained based on large-scale collections of user reviews in e-commerce. The system is capable of asking aspect-based questions in the right order so as to understand the user needs, while (personalized) search is conducted during the conversation, and results are provided when the system feels confident. Experiments on real-world user purchasing data verified the advantages of conversational search and recommendation against conventional search and recommendation algorithms in terms of standard evaluation measures such as NDCG.},

We carefully investigate grocery transaction data and observe three important patterns: products within the same basket complement each other in terms of functionality (complementarity); users tend to purchase products that match their preferences (compatibility); and a significant fraction of users repeatedly purchase the same products over time (loyalty). Unlike conventional e-commerce settings, complementarity and loyalty are particularly predominant in the grocery shopping domain. This motivates a new representation learning approach to leverage complementarity and compatibility holistically, as well as a new recommendation approach to explicitly account for users' 'must-buy' purchases in addition to their overall preferences and needs. Doing so not only improves product classification and recommendation performance on both public and proprietary transaction data covering various grocery store types, but also reveals interesting findings about the relationships between preferences, necessity, and loyalty in consumer purchases.},

abstract = {With the advance of online education systems, accessibility to learning materials has increased. In these systems, students can practice independently and learn from different learning materials over long periods of time. As a result, it is essential to trace students' knowledge states over long learning sequences while maintaining a personalized model of each individual student's progress. However, the existing deep learning-based knowledge tracing models are either not personalized or not tailored for handling long sequences. Handling long sequences are especially essential in the online education environments, in where models are preferred to be updated with the newly collected user data in a timely manner as students could acquire knowledge on each learning activity. In this paper, we propose a knowledge tracing model, Continuous Personalized Knowledge Tracing (CPKT), that can mimic the real-world long-term continuous learning scenario by incorporating a novel online model training paradigm that is suitable for the knowledge tracing problem. To achieve personalized knowledge tracing, we propose two model components: 1) personalized memory slots to maintain learner's knowledge in a lifelong manner, and 2) personalized user embeddings that help to accurately predict the individual responses, correctly detect the personalized knowledge acquisition and forgetting patterns, and better interpret and analyze the learner's progress. Additionally, we propose transition-aware stochastic shared embedding according to the learning transition matrix to regularize the online model training. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness and superiority of CPKT, especially for students with longer sequences.},

However, the constrained budget setting still restricts unlimited ad impressions. As a result, a smart strategy for ad impression selection is necessary for the advertisers to maximize positive user responses such as clicks or conversions, under the constraints of both ad volume and campaign budget. In this paper, we borrow in the idea of top-N ranking and filtering techniques from information retrieval and propose an effective ad impression volume ranking method for each ad campaign, followed by a sequential selection strategy considering the remaining ad volume and budget, to smoothly deliver the volume filtering while maximizing campaign efficiency. The extensive experiments on two benchmarking datasets and a commercial ad platform demonstrate large performance superiority of our proposed solution over traditional methods, especially under tight budgets.},

This paper considers the knowledge graph as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the knowledge graph into recommender systems. Similar to actual ripples propagating on the water, RippleNet stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user's potential interests along links in the knowledge graph. The multiple "ripples" activated by a user's historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item, which could be used for predicting the final clicking probability. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that RippleNet achieves substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book and news recommendation, over several state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Many real-world tasks solved by heterogeneous network embedding methods can be cast as modeling the likelihood of a pairwise relationship between two nodes. For example, the goal of author identification task is to model the likelihood of a paper being written by an author (paper-author pairwise relationship). Existing taskguided embedding methods are node-centric in that they simply measure the similarity between the node embeddings to compute the likelihood of a pairwise relationship between two nodes. However, we claim that for task-guided embeddings, it is crucial to focus on directly modeling the pairwise relationship. In this paper, we propose a novel task-guided pair embedding framework in heterogeneous network, called TaPEm, that directly models the relationship between a pair of nodes that are related to a specific task (e.g., paper-author relationship in author identification). To this end, we 1) propose to learn a pair embedding under the guidance of its associated context path, i.e., a sequence of nodes between the pair, and 2) devise the pair validity classifier to distinguish whether the pair is valid with respect to the specific task at hand. By introducing pair embeddings that capture the semantics behind the pairwise relationships, we are able to learn the fine-grained pairwise relationship between two nodes, which is paramount for task-guided embedding methods. Extensive experiments on author identification task demonstrate that TaPEm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially for authors with few publication records.},

abstract = {Reading is an important activity for individuals. Content-based recommendation systems are, typically, used to recommend scientific papers or news, where search is driven by topic. Literary reading or reading for leisure differs from scientific reading, because users search books not only for their topic but also by author or writing style. Choosing a new book to read can be tricky and recommendation systems can make it easy by selecting books that the user will like. In this paper we study recommendation through writing style and the influence of negative examples in user preferences. Our experiments were conducted in a hybrid set-up that combines a collaborative filtering algorithm with stylometric relevance feedback. Using the LitRec data set, we demonstrate that writing style influences book selection; that book content, characterized with writing style, can be used to improve collaborative filtering results; and that negative examples do not improve final predictions.},

A good recommender system selects a certain item for a specific user by recognizing why the user might like the item. This awareness implies that the system should model the background of the items and the users. This background modeling for recommendation is tackled through the various models of collaborative filtering with auxiliary information. This paper presents variational approaches for collaborative filtering to deal with auxiliary information. The proposed methods encompass variational autoencoders through augmenting structures to model the auxiliary information and to model the implicit user feedback. This augmentation includes the ladder network and the generative adversarial network to extract the low-dimensional representations influenced by the auxiliary information. These two augmentations are the first trial in the venue of the variational autoencoders, and we demonstrate their significant improvement on the performances in the applications of the collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {Friendship is the cornerstone to build a social network. In online social networks, statistics show that the leading reason for user to create a new friendship is due to recommendation. Thus the accuracy of recommendation matters. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Personalized Ranking Deep Neural Network (BayDNN) model for friend recommendation in social networks. With BayDNN, we achieve significant improvement on two public datasets: Epinions and Slashdot. For example, on Epinions dataset, BayDNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 5% improvement on NDCG over the best baseline. The advantages of the proposed BayDNN mainly come from its underlying convolutional neural network (CNN), which offers a mechanism to extract latent deep structural feature representations of the complicated network data, and a novel Bayesian personalized ranking idea, which precisely captures the users' personal bias based on the extracted deep features. To get good parameter estimation for the neural network, we present a fine-tuned pre-training strategy for the proposed BayDNN model based on Poisson and Bernoulli probabilistic models.},

abstract = {The traditional collaborative filtering approaches have been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems: data sparsity and difficulty in scalability. To address these problems, we present a novel scalable item-based collaborative filtering method by using incremental update and local link prediction. By subdividing the computations and analyzing the factors in different cases of item-to-item similarity, we design the incremental update strategies in item-based CF, which can make the recommender system more efficient and scalable. Based on the transitive structure of item similarity graph, we use the local link prediction method to find implicit candidates to alleviate the lack of neighbors in predictions and recommendations caused by the sparsity of data. The experiment results validate that our algorithm can improve the performance of traditional CF, and can increase the efficiency in recommendations.},

Current methods assume that the helpfulness of a review is independent from the readers of that review. However, we argue that the quality of a review may not be the same for different users. In this paper, we employ latent factor models to address this problem. We evaluate the proposed models using a real life database from Epinions.com. The experiments demonstrate that the latent factor models outperform the state-of-the-art approaches and confirms that the helpfulness of a review is indeed not the same for all users.},

abstract = {Accurate modeling of how the visibility of a piece of information varies across time has a wide variety of applications. For example, in an e-commerce site like Amazon, it can help to identify which product is preferred over others; in Twitter, it can predict which hashtag may go viral against others. Visibility of a piece of information, therefore, indicates the ability of a piece of information to attract the attention of the users, against the rest. Therefore, apart from the individual information diffusion processes, the information visibility dynamics also involves a competition process, where each information diffusion process competes against each other to draw the attention of users. Despite models of individual information diffusion processes abounding in literature, modeling the competition process is left unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Competing Recurrent Point Process (CRPP), a probabilistic deep machinery that unifies the nonlinear generative dynamics of a collection of diffusion processes, and inter-process competition - the two ingredients of visibility dynamics. To design this model, we rely on a recurrent neural network (RNN) guided generative framework, where the recurrent unit captures the joint temporal dynamics of a group of processes. This is aided by a discriminative model which captures the underlying competition process by discriminating among the various processes using several ranking functions. On ten diverse datasets crawled from Amazon and Twitter, CRPP offers a substantial performance boost in predicting item visibility against several baselines, thereby achieving significant accuracy in predicting both the collective diffusion mechanism and the underlying competition processes.},

abstract = {Popular online rental services such as Netflix and MoviePilot often manage household accounts. A household account is usually shared by various users who live in the same house, but in general does not provide a mechanism by which current active users are identified, and thus leads to considerable difficulties for making effective personalized recommendations. The identification of the active household members, defined as the discrimination of the users from a given household who are interacting with a system (e.g. an on-demand video service), is thus an interesting challenge for the recommender systems research community. In this paper, we formulate the above task as a classification problem, and address it by means of global and local feature selection methods and classifiers that only exploit time features from past item consumption records. The results obtained from a series of experiments on a real dataset show that some of the proposed methods are able to select relevant time features, which allow simple classifiers to accurately identify active members of household accounts.},

abstract = {Along with the increasing popularity of social web sites, users rely more on the trustworthiness information for many online activities among users. However, such social network data often suffers from severe data sparsity and are not able to provide users with enough information. Therefore, trust prediction has emerged as an important topic in social network research. Traditional approaches explore the topology of trust graph. Previous research in sociology and our life experience suggest that people who are in the same social circle often exhibit similar behavior and tastes. Such ancillary information, is often accessible and therefore could potentially help the trust prediction. In this paper, we address the link prediction problem by aggregating heterogeneous social networks and propose a novel joint manifold factorization (JMF) method. Our new joint learning model explores the user group level similarity between correlated graphs and simultaneously learns the individual graph structure, therefore the shared structures and patterns from multiple social networks can be utilized to enhance the prediction tasks. As a result, we not only improve the trust prediction in the target graph, but also facilitate other information retrieval tasks in the auxiliary graphs. To optimize the objective function, we break down the proposed objective function into several manageable sub-problems, then further establish the theoretical convergence with the aid of auxiliary function. Extensive experiments were conducted on real world data sets and all empirical results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Anchor links connect information entities, such as entities of movies or products, across networks from different sources, and thus information in these networks can be transferred directly via anchor links. Therefore, anchor links have great value to many cross-network applications, such as cross-network social link prediction and cross-network recommendation. In this paper, we focus on studying the recommendation problem that can provide ratings of items or services. To address the problem, we propose a Cross-network Collaborative Matrix Factorization (CCMF) recommendation framework based on broad learning setting, which can effectively integrate multi-source information and alleviate the sparse information problem in each individual network. Based on item anchor links CCMF can fuse item similarity information and item latent information across networks from different sources. And different from most of the traditional works, CCMF can make multi-source recommendation tasks collaborate together via the information transfer based on the broad learning setting. During the transfer process, a novel cross-network similarity transfer method is applied to keep the consistency of item similarities between two different networks, and a domain adaptation matrix is used to overcome the domain difference problem. We conduct experiments to compare the proposed CCMF method with both classic and state-of-the-art recommendation techniques. The experimental results illustrate that CCMF outperforms other methods in different experimental circumstances, and has great advantages on dealing with different data sparse problems.},

abstract = {As a promising new technology with the unique properties like high efficiency, scalability and fault tolerance, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology is used as the underlying network to build new Internet-scale applications. However, one of the well known issues in such an application (for example WWW) is that the distribution of data popularities is heavily tailed with a Zipf-like distribution. With consideration of the skewed popularity we adopt a proactive caching approach to handle the challenge, and focus on two key problems: where (i.e. the placement strategy: where to place the replicas) and how (i.e. the degree problem: how many replicas are assigned to one specific content)? For the where problem, we propose a novel approach which can be generally applied to structured P2P networks. Next, we solve two optimization objectives related to the how problem: MAX_PERF and MIN_COST. Our solution is called &lt;B&gt;PoPCache&lt;/B&gt;, and we discover two interesting properties: (1) the number of replicas assigned to each content is proportional to its popularity; (2) the derived optimal solutions are related to the entropy of popularity. To our knowledge, none of the previous works has mentioned such results. Finally, we apply the results of PoPCache to propose a P2P base web caching, called as Web-PoPCache. By means of web cache trace driven simulation, our extensive evaluation results demonstrate the advantages of PoPCache and Web-PoPCache.},

Using sentiment analysis, we quantify the collective emotions expressed by the viewers, finding that democrat campaigns elicited more positive collective emotions than republican campaigns. Techniques from computational social science allow us to measure virality of the videos of each campaign, to find that democrat videos are shared faster but republican ones are remembered longer inside the community.

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering(CF) is a popular way to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. Generally, two kinds of approaches to CF, the local neighborhood methods and the global matrix factorization models, have been widely studied. Though some previous researches target on combining the complementary advantages of both approaches, the performance is still limited due to the extreme sparsity of the rating data. Therefore, it is necessary to consider more information for better reflecting user preference and item content. To that end, in this paper, by leveraging the extra tagging data, we propose a novel unified two-stage recommendation framework, named Neighborhood-aware Probabilistic Matrix Factorization(NHPMF). Specifically, we first use the tagging data to select neighbors of each user and each item, then add unique Gaussian distributions on each user's(item's) latent feature vector in the matrix factorization to ensure similar users(items) will have similar latent features}. Since the proposed method can effectively explores the external data source(i.e., tagging data) in a unified probabilistic model, it leads to more accurate recommendations. Extensive experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate that our NHPMF model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Prescription (aka Rx) drugs can be easily overprescribed and lead to drug abuse or opioid overdose. Accordingly, a state-run prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) in the United States has been developed to reduce Overprescribing. However, PDMP has limited capability in detecting patients' potential overprescribing behaviors, impairing its effectiveness in preventing drug abuse and overdose in patients. Despite a few machine-learning-based methods that have been proposed for detecting overprescribing, they usually ignore the patient prescribing behavior and their performances are not satisfying. In light of this, we propose a novel model RxNet for overprescribing detection in PDMP. RxNet builds a dynamic heterogeneous graph to model Rx refills that are essentially prescribing and dispensing (P&amp;D) relationships among various Rx entries (e.g., patients) whose representations are encoded by graph neural network. In addition, to explore the dynamic Rx-refill behavior and medical condition variation of patients, an RxLSTM network is designed to update representations of patients. Based on the output of RxLSTM, a dosing-adaptive network is leveraged to extract and recalibrate dosing patterns and obtain the refined patient representations which are finally utilized for overprescribing detection. The extensive experimental results on a 1-year Ohio PDMP data demonstrate that RxNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting patients at high risk of opioid overdose and drug abuse, with an average of 5.7% and 7.3% improvement on F1 score respectively.},

abstract = {Recommending a ranked list of interesting venues to users based on their preferences has become a key functionality in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Yelp and Gowalla. Bayesian Personalised Ranking (BPR) is a popular pairwise recommendation technique that is used to generate the ranked list of venues of interest to a user, by leveraging the user's implicit feedback such as their check-ins as instances of positive feedback, while randomly sampling other venues as negative instances. To alleviate the sparsity that affects the usefulness of recommendations by BPR for users with few check-ins, various approaches have been proposed in the literature to incorporate additional sources of information such as the social links between users, the textual content of comments, as well as the geographical location of the venues. However, such approaches can only readily leverage one source of additional information for negative sampling. Instead, we propose a novel Personalised Ranking Framework with Multiple sampling Criteria (PRFMC) that leverages both geographical influence and social correlation to enhance the effectiveness of BPR. In particular, we apply a multi-centre Gaussian model and a power-law distribution method, to capture geographical influence and social correlation when sampling negative venues, respectively. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three large-scale datasets from the Yelp, Gowalla and Brightkite LBSNs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of fusing both geographical influence and social correlation in our proposed PRFMC framework and its superiority in comparison to BPR-based and other similar ranking approaches. Indeed, our PRFMC approach attains a 37% improvement in MRR over a recently proposed approach that identifies negative venues only from social links.},

abstract = {Venue recommendation is an important application for Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), such as Yelp, and has been extensively studied in recent years. Matrix Factorisation (MF) is a popular Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique that can suggest relevant venues to users based on an assumption that similar users are likely to visit similar venues. In recent years, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to tasks such as speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. Building upon this momentum, various approaches for recommendation have been proposed in the literature to enhance the effectiveness of MF-based approaches by exploiting neural network models such as: word embeddings to incorporate auxiliary information (e.g. textual content of comments); and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture sequential properties of observed user-venue interactions. However, such approaches rely on the traditional inner product of the latent factors of users and venues to capture the concept of collaborative filtering, which may not be sufficient to capture the complex structure of user-venue interactions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Recurrent Collaborative Filtering framework (DRCF) with a pairwise ranking function that aims to capture user-venue interactions in a CF manner from sequences of observed feedback by leveraging Multi-Layer Perception and Recurrent Neural Network architectures. Our proposed framework consists of two components: namely Generalised Recurrent Matrix Factorisation (GRMF) and Multi-Level Recurrent Perceptron (MLRP) models. In particular, GRMF and MLRP learn to model complex structures of user-venue interactions using element-wise and dot products as well as the concatenation of latent factors. In addition, we propose a novel sequence-based negative sampling approach that accounts for the sequential properties of observed feedback and geographical location of venues to enhance the quality of venue suggestions, as well as alleviate the cold-start users problem. Experiments on three large checkin and rating datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed framework by outperforming various state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, given the deluge of tweets, it is a challenge for individuals to find relevant and appropriately ranked information. We propose to address this knowledge management problem by going beyond the general perspective of information finding in Twitter, that asks: "What is happening right now?", towards an individual user perspective, and ask: "What is interesting to me right now?" In this paper, we consider collaborative filtering as an online ranking problem and present RMFO, a method that creates, in real-time, user-specific rankings for a set of tweets based on individual preferences that are inferred from the user's past system interactions. Experiments on the 476 million Twitter tweets dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's global trend and Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a highly competitive state-of-the-art Collaborative Filtering technique, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.},

abstract = {Retweet cascades play an essential role in information diffusion in Twitter. Popular tweets reflect the current trends in Twitter, while Twitter itself is one of the most important online media. Thus, understanding the reasons why a tweet becomes popular is of great interest for sociologists, marketers and social media researches. What is even more important is the possibility to make a prognosis of a tweet's future popularity. Besides the scientific significance of such possibility, this sort of prediction has lots of practical applications such as breaking news detection, viral marketing etc. In this paper we try to forecast how many retweets a given tweet will gain during a fixed time period. We train an algorithm that predicts the number of retweets during time T since the initial moment. In addition to a standard set of features we utilize several new ones. One of the most important features is the flow of the cascade. Another one is PageRank on the retweet graph, which can be considered as the measure of influence of users.},

abstract = {Popular microblogging sites such as Tumblr have attracted hundreds of millions of users as a content sharing platform, where users can create rich content in the form of posts that are shared with other users who follow them. Due to the sheer amount of posts created on such services, an important task is to make quality recommendations of blogs for users to follow. Apart from traditional recommender system settings where the follower graph is the main data source, additional side-information of users and blogs such as user activity (e.g., like and reblog) and rich content (e.g., text and images) are also available to be exploited for enhanced recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel boosted inductive matrix completion method (BIMC) for blog recommendation. BIMC is an additive low-rank model for user-blog preferences consisting of two components; one component captures the low-rank structure of follow relationships and the other captures the latent structure using side-information. Our model formulation combines the power of the recently proposed inductive matrix completion (IMC) model (for side-information) together with a standard matrix completion (MC) model (for low-rank structure). Furthermore, we utilize recently developed deep learning techniques to obtain semantically rich feature representations of text and images that are incorporated in BIMC. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset from Tumblr illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed BIMC method.},

abstract = {On Twitter-like social media sites, the re-posting statuses or tweets of other users are usually considered to be the key mechanism for spreading information. How to predict whether a tweet will be retweeted by a user has received increasing attention in recent years. Previous methods studied the problem using various linguistic features, personal information of users, and many other manually constructed features to achieve the task. Usually, feature engineering is a laborious task, we require to obtain the external sources and they are difficult or not always available. Recently, deep learning methods have been used in the industry and research community for their ability to learn optimal features automatically and in many tasks, deep learning methods can achieve state-of-the art performance, such as natural language processing, computer vision, image classification and so on. In this work, we proposed a novel attention-based deep neural network to incorporate contextual and social information for this task. We used embeddings to represent the user, the user's attention interests, the author and tweet respectively. To train and evaluate the proposed methods, we also constructed a large dataset collected from Twitter. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve better results than the previous state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Data sparsity is a long-standing challenge for recommender systems based on collaborative filtering. A promising solution for this problem is multi-context recommendation, i.e., leveraging users' explicit or implicit feedback from multiple contexts. In multi-context recommendation, various types of interactions between entities (users and items) are combined to alleviate data sparsity of a single context in a collective manner. Two issues are crucial for multi-context recommendation: (1) How to differentiate context-specific factors from entity-intrinsic factors shared across contexts? (2) How to capture the salient phenomenon that some entities are insensitive to contexts while others are remarkably context-dependent? Previous methods either do not consider context-specific factors, or assume that a context imposes equal influence on different entities, limiting their capability of combating data sparsity problem by taking full advantage of multiple contexts.In this paper, we propose a context-adaptive matrix factorization method for multi-context recommendation by simultaneously modeling context-specific factors and entity-intrinsic factors in a unified model. We learn an entity-intrinsic latent factor for every entity, and a context-specific latent factor for every entity in each context. Meanwhile, using a context-entity mixture parameter matrix we explicitly model the extent to which each context imposes influence on each entity. Experiments on two real scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous multi-context recommendation methods on all different sparsity levels.Such a consistent performance promotion forms the unique superiority of our method, enabling it to be a reliable model for multi-context recommendation.},

abstract = {Mobile applications (Apps) could expose children or adolescents to mature themes such as sexual content, violence and drug use, which results in an inappropriate security and privacy risk for them. Therefore, mobile platforms provide rating policies to label the maturity levels of Apps and the reasons why an App has a given maturity level, which enables parents to select maturity-appropriate Apps for their children. However, existing approaches to implement these maturity rating policies are either costly (because of expensive manually labeling) or inaccurate (because of no centralized controls). In this work, we aim to design and build a machine learning framework to automatically predict maturity levels for mobile Apps and the associated reasons with a high accuracy and a low cost.To this end, we take a multi-label classification approach to predict the mature contents in a given App and then label the maturity level according to a rating policy. Specifically, we extract novel features from App descriptions by leveraging deep learning technique to automatically capture the semantic similarity of pairwise words and adapt Support Vector Machine to capture label correlations with pearson correlation in a multi-label classification setting. Moreover, we evaluate our approach and various baseline methods using datasets that we collected from both App Store and Google Play. We demonstrate that, with only App descriptions, our approach already achieves 85% Precision for predicting mature contents and 79% Precision for predicting maturity levels, which substantially outperforms baseline methods.},

abstract = {Recently heterogeneous information network (HIN) analysis has attracted a lot of attention, and many data mining tasks have been exploited on HIN. As an important data mining task, recommender system includes a lot of object types (e.g., users, movies, actors, and interest groups in movie recommendation) and the rich relations among object types, which naturally constitute a HIN. The comprehensive information integration and rich semantic information of HIN make it promising to generate better recommendations. However, conventional HINs do not consider the attribute values on links, and the widely used meta path in HIN may fail to accurately capture semantic relations among objects, due to the existence of rating scores (usually ranging from 1 to 5) between users and items in recommender system. In this paper, we are the first to propose the weighted HIN and weighted meta path concepts to subtly depict the path semantics through distinguishing different link attribute values. Furthermore, we propose a semantic path based personalized recommendation method SemRec to predict the rating scores of users on items. Through setting meta paths, SemRec not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information but also obtains prioritized and personalized weights representing user preferences on paths. Experiments on two real datasets illustrate that SemRec achieves better recommendation performance through flexibly integrating information with the help of weighted meta paths.},

abstract = {Sentiment classification is an important problem in tweets mining. There lack labeled data and rating mechanism for generating them in Twitter service. And topics in Twitter are more diverse while sentiment classifiers always dedicate themselves to a specific domain or topic. Thus it is a challenge to make sentiment classification adaptive to diverse topics without sufficient labeled data. Therefore we formally propose an adaptive multiclass SVM model which transfers an initial common sentiment classifier to a topic-adaptive one. To tackle the tweet sparsity, non-text features are explored besides the conventional text features, which are intuitively split into two views. An iterative algorithm is proposed for solving this model by alternating among three steps: optimization, unlabeled data selection and adaptive feature expansion steps. The algorithm alternatively minimizes the margins of two independent objectives on different views to learn coefficient matrices, which are collaboratively used for unlabeled tweets selection from the topic that the algorithm is adapting to. And then topic-adaptive sentiment words are expended based on the above selection, in turn to help the first two steps find more confident and unlabeled tweets and boost the final performance. Comparing with the well-known supervised sentiment classifiers and semi-supervised approaches, our algorithm achieves promising increases in accuracy averagely on the 6 topics from public tweet corpus.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of Twitter renders improved trust- worthiness and relevance assessment of tweets much more important for search. However, given the limitations on the size of tweets, it is hard to extract measures for ranking from the tweets? content alone. We present a novel ranking method called RAProp, which combines two orthogonal measures of relevance and trustworthiness of a tweet. The first, called Feature Score, measures the trustworthiness of the source of the tweet by extracting features from a 3-layer Twitter ecosystem consisting of users, tweets and webpages. The second measure, called agreement analysis, estimates the trustworthiness of the content of a tweet by analyzing whether the content is independently corroborated by other tweets. We view the candidate result set of tweets as the vertices of a graph, with the edges measuring the estimated agreement between each pair of tweets. The feature score is propagated over this agreement graph to compute the top-k tweets that have both trustworthy sources and independent corroboration. The evaluation of our method on 16 million tweets from the TREC 2011 Microblog Dataset shows that for top-30 precision, we achieve 53% better precision than the current best performing method on the data set, and an improvement of 300% over current Twitter Search.},

abstract = {Low-rank Matrix Factorization (MF) methods provide one of the simplest and most effective approaches to collaborative filtering. This paper is the first to investigate the problem of efficient retrieval of recommendations in a MF framework. We reduce the retrieval in a MF model to an apparently simple task of finding the maximum dot-product for the user vector over the set of item vectors. However, to the best of our knowledge the problem of efficiently finding the maximum dot-product in the general case has never been studied. To this end, we propose two techniques for efficient search -- (i) We index the item vectors in a binary spatial-partitioning metric tree and use a simple branch and-bound algorithm with a novel bounding scheme to efficiently obtain exact solutions. (ii) We use spherical clustering to index the users on the basis of their preferences and pre-compute recommendations only for the representative user of each cluster to obtain extremely efficient approximate solutions. We obtain a theoretical error bound which determines the quality of any approximate result and use it to control the approximation. Both these simple techniques are fairly independent of each other and hence are easily combined to further improve recommendation retrieval efficiency. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world collaborative-filtering datasets, demonstrating more than \texttimes{}7 speedup (with respect to the naive linear search) for the exact solution and over \texttimes{}250 speedup for approximate solutions by combining both techniques.},

To tackle this cluster of closely related problems in a principled approach, we proposed Topic Expertise Model (TEM), a novel probabilistic generative model with GMM hybrid, to jointly model topics and expertise by integrating textual content model and link structure analysis. Based on TEM results, we proposed CQARank to measure user interests and expertise score under different topics. Leveraging the question answering history based on long-term community reviews and voting, our method could find experts with both similar topical preference and high topical expertise.

abstract = {Online advertising has become a key source of revenue for both web search engines and online publishers. For them, the ability of allocating right ads to right webpages is critical because any mismatched ads would not only harm web users' satisfactions but also lower the ad income. In this paper, we study how online publishers could optimally select ads to maximize their ad incomes over time. The conventional offline, content-based matching between webpages and ads is a fine start but cannot solve the problem completely because good matching does not necessarily lead to good payoff. Moreover, with the limited display impressions, we need to balance the need of selecting ads to learn true ad payoffs (exploration) with that of allocating ads to generate high immediate payoffs based on the current belief (exploitation). In this paper, we address the problem by employing Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and discuss how to utilize the correlation of ads to improve the efficiency of the exploration and increase ad incomes in a long run. Our mathematical derivation shows that the belief states of correlated ads can be naturally updated using a formula similar to collaborative filtering. To test our model, a real world ad dataset from a major search engine is collected and categorized. Experimenting over the data, we provide an analyse of the effect of the underlying parameters, and demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform other strong baselines.},

abstract = {Personalized article recommendation is important for news portals to improve user engagement. Existing work quantifies engagement primarily through click rates. We suggest that quality of recommendations may be improved by exploiting different types of "post-read" engagement signals like sharing, commenting, printing and e-mailing article links. Specifically, we propose a multi-faceted ranking problem for recommending articles, where each facet corresponds to a ranking task that seeks to maximize actions of a particular post-read type (e.g., ranking articles to maximize sharing actions). Our approach is to predict the probability that a user would take a post-read action on an article, so that articles can be ranked according to such probabilities. However, post-read actions are rare events --- enormous data sparsity makes the problem challenging. We meet the challenge by exploiting correlations across different post-read action types through a novel locally augmented tensor (LAT) model, so that the ranking performance of a particular action type can be improved by leveraging data from all other action types. Through extensive experiments, we show that our LAT model significantly outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art factor models, logistic regression and IR models.},

abstract = {Readers of a news article often read its comments contributed by other readers. By reading comments, readers obtain not only complementary information about this news article but also the opinions from other readers. However, the existing ranking mechanisms for comments (e.g., by recency or by user rating) fail to offer an overall picture of topics discussed in comments. In this paper, we first propose to study Topic-driven Reader Comments Summarization (Torcs) problem. We observe that many news articles from a news stream are related to each other; so are their comments. Hence, news articles and their associated comments provide context information for user commenting. To implicitly capture the context information, we propose two topic models to address the Torcs problem, namely, Master-Slave Topic Model (MSTM) and Extended Master-Slave Topic Model (EXTM). Both models treat a news article as a master document and each of its comments as a slave document. MSTM model constrains that the topics discussed in comments have to be derived from the commenting news article. On the other hand, EXTM model allows generating words of comments using both the topics derived from the commenting news article, and the topics derived from all comments themselves. Both models are used to group comments into topic clusters. We then use two ranking mechanisms Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Rating &amp; Length (RL) to select a few most representative comments from each comment cluster. To evaluate the two models, we conducted experiments on 1005 Yahoo! News articles with more than one million comments. Our experimental results show that EXTM significantly outperforms MSTM by perplexity. Through a user study, we also confirm that the comment summary generated by EXTM achieves better intra-cluster topic cohesion and inter-cluster topic diversity.},

abstract = {Consumer review sites and recommender systems typically rely on a large volume of user-contributed ratings, which makes rating acquisition an essential component in the design of such systems. User ratings are then summarized to provide an aggregate score representing a popular evaluation of an item. An inherent problem in such summarization is potential bias due to raters self-selection and heterogeneity in terms of experience, tastes and rating scale interpretation. There are two major approaches to collecting ratings, which have different advantages and disadvantages. One is to allow a large number of volunteers to choose and rate items directly (a method employed by e.g. Yelp and Google Places). Alternatively, a panel of raters may be maintained and invited to rate a predefined set of items at regular intervals (such as in Zagat Survey). The latter approach arguably results in more consistent reviews and reduced selection bias, however, at the expense of much smaller coverage (fewer rated items).In this paper, we examine the two different approaches to collecting user ratings of restaurants and explore the question of whether it is possible to reconcile them. Specifically, we study the problem of inferring the more calibrated Zagat Survey ratings (which we dub 'expert ratings') from the user-generated ratings ('grassroots') in Google Places. To that effect, we employ latent factor models and provide a probabilistic treatment of the ordinal rankings. We can predict Zagat Survey ratings accurately from ad hoc user-generated ratings by joint optimization on two datasets. We analyze the resulting model, and find that users become more discerning as they submit more ratings. We also describe an approach towards cross-city recommendations, answering questions such as 'What is the equivalent of the Per Se restaurant in Chicago'?},

abstract = {The adoption of hashtags in major social networks including Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ is a strong evidence of its importance in facilitating information diffusion and social chatting. To understand the factors (e.g., user interest, posting time and tweet content) that may affect hashtag annotation in Twitter and to capture the implicit relations between latent topics in tweets and their corresponding hashtags, we propose two PLSA-style topic models to model the hashtag annotation behavior in Twitter. Content-Pivoted Model (CPM) assumes that tweet content guides the generation of hashtags while Hashtag-Pivoted Model (HPM) assumes that hashtags guide the generation of tweet content. Both models jointly incorporate user, time, hashtag and tweet content in a probabilistic framework. The PLSA-style models also enable us to verify the impact of social factor on hashtag annotation by introducing social network regularization in the two models. We evaluate the proposed models using perplexity and demonstrate their effectiveness in two applications: retrospective hashtag annotation and related hashtag discovery. Our results show that HPM outperforms CPM by perplexity and both user and time are important factors that affect model performance. In addition, incorporating social network regularization does not improve model performance. Our experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models in both applications compared with baseline methods.},

abstract = {Search engine logs contain a large amount of click-through data that can be leveraged as soft indicators of relevance. In this paper we address the sponsored search retrieval problem which is to find and rank relevant ads to a search query. We propose a new technique to determine the relevance of an ad document for a search query using click-through data. The method builds on a collaborative filtering approach to discover new ads related to a query using a click graph. It is implemented on a graph with several million edges and scales to larger sizes easily. The proposed method is compared to three different baselines that are state-of-the-art for a commercial search engine. Evaluations on editorial data indicate that the model discovers many new ads not retrieved by the baseline methods. The ads from the new approach are on average of better quality than the baselines.},

abstract = {The spreading of innovations among individuals and organizations in a social network has been extensively studied. Although the recent studies among the social computing and data mining communities have produced various insightful conclusions about the diffusion process of innovations by focusing on the properties and evolution of social network structures, less attention has been paid to the interrelationships among the multiple innovations being diffused, such as the competitive and collaborative relationships between innovations. In this paper, we take a formal quantitative approach to address how different pieces of innovations socialize with each other and how the interrelationships among innovations affect users' adoption behavior, which provides a novel perspective of understanding the diffusion of innovations. Networks of innovations are constructed by mining large scale text collections in an unsupervised fashion. We are particularly interested in the following questions: what are the meaningful metrics on the network of innovations? What effects do these metrics exert on the diffusion of innovations? Do these effects vary among users with different adoption preferences or communication styles? While existing studies primarily address social influence, we provide a detailed discussion of how innovations interrelate and influence the diffusion process.},

abstract = {In online advertising, the Internet users may be exposed to a sequence of different ad campaigns, i.e., display ads, search, or referrals from multiple channels, before led up to any final sales conversion and transaction. For both campaigners and publishers, it is fundamentally critical to estimate the contribution from ad campaign touch-points during the customer journey (conversion funnel) and assign the right credit to the right ad exposure accordingly. However, the existing research on the multi-touch attribution problem lacks a principled way of utilizing the users' pre-conversion actions (i.e., clicks), and quite often fails to model the sequential patterns among the touch points from a user's behavior data. To make it worse, the current industry practice is merely employing a set of arbitrary rules as the attribution model, e.g., the popular last-touch model assigns 100% credit to the final touch-point regardless of actual attributions. In this paper, we propose a Dual-attention Recurrent Neural Network (DARNN) for the multi-touch attribution problem. It learns the attribution values through an attention mechanism directly from the conversion estimation objective. To achieve this, we utilize sequence-to-sequence prediction for user clicks, and combine both post-view and post-click attribution patterns together for the final conversion estimation. To quantitatively benchmark attribution models, we also propose a novel yet practical attribution evaluation scheme through the proxy of budget allocation (under the estimated attributions) over ad channels. The experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains of our attribution model against the state of the art.},

abstract = {Factorization Machines (FM) have been recognized as an effective learning paradigm for incorporating complex relations to improve item recommendation in recommender systems. However, one open issue of FM lies in its factorized representation (latent factors) for each feature in the observed feature space, a characteristic often resulting in a large parameter space. Therefore, training FM (in other words, learning a large number of parameters in FM) is a computationally expensive task. Our work targets to improve the scalability of FM by building it in a distributed environment. We propose a new system framework that integrates Parameter Server (PS) with the Map/Reduce (MR) framework. In addition to the data parallelism achieved via MR, our framework particularly benefits from PS for model parallelism, a critical characteristic for learning with a large number of parameters in FM. We further address two specific challenges in our system, namely, communication cost and parameter update collision. Through both offline and online experiments on recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed system framework succeeds in scaling up FM for very large datasets, while it also maintains competitive performance on recommendation quality compared to alternative baselines.},

Broadcast is a useful data dissemination technique because of its scalability, but is lacking when it comes to response time. Increasing the number of available broadcast channels is a logical way of increasing throughput. Little work, however, has considered the access structures necessary for making effective use of the additional channels. We propose various indexing schemes for a multi-channel broadcast program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in decreasing response time and tuning time via extensive experiments over a wide range of parameters.},

One of the main reasons for this inferior performance is the difficulty to attract a critical mass of users that would make the peer-to-peer system truly competitive. We argue that decentralized search mechanisms should not aim at replacing existing engines, but instead complement them by adding novel functionalities that would be difficult to provide in a centralized manner. This paper introduces an example of such a complementary search mechanism and presents the design of a distributed collaborative system for leveraging user feedback and document/user profiling information.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization (MF) has become the most popular technique for recommender systems due to its promising performance. Recently, distributed (parallel) MF models have received much attention from researchers of big data community. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called distributed stochastic alternating direction methods of multipliers (DS-ADMM), for large-scale MF problems. DS-ADMM is a distributed stochastic variant of ADMM. In particular, we first devise a new data split strategy to make the distributed MF problem fit for the ADMM framework. Then, a stochastic ADMM scheme is designed for learning. Finally, we implement DS-ADMM based on message passing interface (MPI), which can run on clusters with multiple machines (nodes). Experiments on several data sets from recommendation applications show that our DS-ADMM model can outperform other state-of-the-art distributed MF models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new model for collaborative filtering. The motivation of this work comes from the fact that two users with very similar preferences on items may have very different rating schemes. For example, one user may tend to assign a higher rating to all items than another user. Unlike previous models of collaborative filtering, which determine the similarity between two users only based on their rating performance, our model treats the user's preferences on items separately from the user's rating scheme. More specifically, for each user, we build two separate models: a preference model capturing which items are favored by the user and a rating model capturing how the user would rate an item given the preference information. The similarity of two users is computed based on the underlying preference model, instead of the surface ratings. We compare the new model with several representative previous approaches on two data sets. Experiment results show that the new model outperforms all the previous approaches that are tested consistently on both data sets.},

abstract = {With the development of Web applications, large scale data are popular; and they are not only getting richer, but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways, which brings about multi-view data with implicit structure. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian mixture regression model, which discovers and then exploits the relationships among multiple views of the data to perform various machine learning tasks. A stochastic EM inference and learning algorithm is derived; and a parallel implementation in Hadoop MapReduce [9] paradigm is developed to scale up the learning. We apply the developed model and algorithm on click-through-rate (CTR) prediction and campaign targeting recommendation in online advertising to measure its effectiveness. The experiments on both synthetic data and large scale ads serving data from a real world online advertising exchange demonstrate the superior CTR prediction accuracy of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The results also show that our model can recommend high performance targeting features for online advertising campaigns.},
