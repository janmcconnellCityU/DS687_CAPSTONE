abstract = {In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content, limiting the system’s ability to surface novel or serendipitous items—key elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ’s sub-item architecture to model personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings—latent structures not accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty. Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at .},

abstract = {In this paper we present our 2nd place solution to ACM RecSys 2021 Challenge organized by Twitter. The challenge aims to predict user engagement for a set of tweets, offering an exceptionally large data set of 1 billion data points sampled from over four weeks of real Twitter interactions. Each data point contains multiple sources of information, such as tweet text along with engagement features, user features, and tweet features. The challenge brings the problem close to a real production environment by introducing strict latency constraints in the model evaluation phase: the average inference time for single tweet engagement prediction is limited to 6ms on a single CPU core with 64GB memory. Our proposed model relies on extensive feature engineering performed with methods such as the Efficient Manifold Density Estimator (EMDE) - our previously introduced algorithm based on Locality Sensitive Hashing method, and novel Fourier Feature Encoding, among others. In total, we create numerous features describing user twitter account status and content of a tweet. In order to adhere to the strict latency constraints, the underlying model is a simple residual feed-forward neural network. The system is a variation of our previous methods which proved successful in KDD Cup 2021, WSDM Challenge 2021, and SIGIR eCom Challenge 2020.

abstract = {Several studies have identified discrepancies between the popularity of items in user profiles and the corresponding recommendation lists. Such behavior, which concerns a variety of recommendation algorithms, is referred to as popularity bias. Existing work predominantly adopts simple statistical measures, such as the difference of mean or median popularity, to quantify popularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics other than the inclination to popular content. In this work, in contrast, we propose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and recommendation list) in terms of median, a variety of statistical moments, as well as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions (Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kendall’s τ rank-order correlation). This results in a more detailed picture of the characteristics of popularity bias. Furthermore, we investigate whether such algorithmic popularity bias affects users of different genders in the same way. We focus on music recommendation and conduct experiments on the recently released standardized LFM-2b dataset, containing listening profiles of Last.fm users. We investigate the algorithmic popularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative filtering and two baselines). Our experiments show that (1) the studied metrics provide novel insights into popularity bias in comparison with only using average differences, (2) algorithms less inclined towards popularity bias amplification do not necessarily perform worse in terms of utility (NDCG), (3) the majority of the investigated recommenders intensify the popularity bias of the female users.},

abstract = {Review has been proven to be an important information in recommendation. Different from the overall user-item rating matrix, it can provide textual information that exhibits why a user likes an item or not. Recently, more and more researchers have paid attention on review-based rating prediction. There are two challenging issues: how to extract representative features to characterize users / items from reviews and how to leverage them for recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a Neural Gaussian Mixture Model (NGMM) for review-based rating prediction task. Among it, the review textual information is used to construct two parallel neural networks for users and items respectively, so that the users' preferences and items' properties can be sufficiently extracted and represented as two latent vectors. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together and model user-item rating based on the features learned from reviews. Specifically, each rating is modeled via a Gaussian mixture model, where each Gaussian component has zero variance, the mean described by the corresponding component in user's latent vector and the weight indicated by the corresponding component in item's latent vector. Extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world Amazon review datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed NGMM model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in review-based rating prediction task.},

abstract = {Recommendations from the long tail of the popularity distribution of items are generally considered to be particularly valuable. On the other hand, recommendation accuracy tends to decrease towards the long tail. In this paper, we quantitatively examine this trade-off between item popularity and recommendation accuracy. To this end, we assume that there is a selection bias towards popular items in the available data. This allows us to define a new accuracy measure that can be gradually tuned towards the long tail. We show that, under this assumption, this measure has the desirable property of providing nearly unbiased estimates concerning recommendation accuracy. In turn, this also motivates a refinement for training collaborative-filtering approaches. In various experiments with real-world data, including a user study, empirical evidence suggests that only a small, if any, bias of the recommendations towards less popular items is appreciated by users.},

abstract = {Online reviews play a vital role in the decision-making process for online users. Helpful reviews are usually buried in a large number of unhelpful reviews, and with the consistently increasing number of reviews, it becomes more and more difficult for online users to find helpful reviews. Therefore most online review websites allow online users to rate the helpfulness of a review and a global helpfulness score is computed for the review based on its available ratings. However, in reality, user-specified helpfulness ratings for reviews are very sparse - a few reviews attract large numbers of helpfulness ratings while most reviews obtain few or even no helpfulness ratings. The available helpfulness ratings are too sparse for online users to assess the helpfulness of reviews. Also the helpfulness of a review is not necessarily equally useful for all users and users with different background may treat the helpfulness of a review very differently. The user idiosyncracy of review helpfulness motivates us to study the problem of review helpfulness rating prediction in this paper. We first identify various types of context information, model them mathematically, and propose a context-aware review helpfulness rating prediction framework CAP. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of context awareness in solving the review helpfulness rating prediction problem.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have become de facto tools for suggesting items that are of potential interest to users. Predicting a user's rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.},

abstract = {Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review texts. This review information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties, as well as enhancing the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review texts from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly which enable the interaction between users and items in a similar way as matrix factorization. The local attention provides us insight on a user's preferences or an item's properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on the semantic meaning of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by testing on popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factor and topical (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). Our proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classification and recommendation. These results also confirm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.},

abstract = {Recommender systems predict user preferences based on a range of available information. For systems in which users generate streams of content (e.g., blogs, periodically-updated newsfeeds), users may rate the produced content that they read, and be given accurate predictions about future content they are most likely to prefer. We design a distributed mechanism for predicting user ratings that avoids the disclosure of information to a centralized authority or an untrusted third party: users disclose the rating they give to certain content only to the user that produced this content.We demonstrate how rating prediction in this context can be formulated as a matrix factorization problem. Using this intuition, we propose a distributed gradient descent algorithm for its solution that abides with the above restriction on how information is exchanged between users. We formally analyse the convergence properties of this algorithm, showing that it reduces a weighted root mean square error of the accuracy of predictions. Although our algorithm may be used many different ways, we evaluate it on the Neflix data set and prediction problem as a benchmark. In addition to the improved privacy properties that stem from its distributed nature, our algorithm is competitive with current centralized solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's fast convergence in practice by conducting an online experiment with a prototype user-generated content exchange system implemented as a Facebook application.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique for rating prediction in recommender systems. Memory based collaborative filtering algorithms assign weights to the users to capture similarities between them. The weighted average of similar users' ratings for the test item is output as prediction. We propose a memory based algorithm that is markedly different from the existing approaches. We use preference relations instead of absolute ratings for similarity calculations, as preference relations between items are generally more consistent than ratings across like-minded users. Each user's ratings are viewed as a preference graph. Similarity weights are learned using an iterative method motivated by online learning. These weights are used to create an aggregate preference graph. Ratings are inferred to maximally agree with this aggregate graph. The use of preference relations allows the rating of an item to be influenced by other items, which is not the case in the weighted-average approaches of the existing techniques. This is very effective when the data is sparse, specially for the items rated by few users. Our experiments show that the our method outperforms other methods in the sparse regions. However, for dense regions, sometimes our results are comparable to the competing approaches, and sometimes worse.},

abstract = {The literature on recommender systems distinguishes typically between two broad categories of measuring recommendation accuracy: rating prediction, often quantified in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), and ranking, measured in terms of metrics like precision and recall, among others. In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item.},

abstract = {Online Social Rating Networks (SRNs) such as Epinions and Flixter, allow users to form several implicit social networks, through their daily interactions like co-commenting on the same products, or similarly co-rating products. The majority of earlier work in Rating Prediction and Recommendation of products (e.g. Collaborative Filtering) mainly takes into account ratings of users on products. However, in SRNs users can also built their explicit social network by adding each other as friends. In this paper, we propose Social-Union, a method which combines similarity matrices derived from heterogeneous (unipartite and bipartite) explicit or implicit SRNs. Moreover, we propose an effective weighting strategy of SRNs influence based on their structured density. We also generalize our model for combining multiple social networks. We perform an extensive experimental comparison of the proposed method against existing rating prediction and product recommendation algorithms, using synthetic and two real data sets (Epinions and Flixter). Our experimental results show that our Social-Union algorithm is more effective in predicting rating and recommending products in SRNs.},

abstract = {With the implementation of privacy protection laws such as GDPR, it is increasingly difficult for organizations to legally collect user data. However, a typical recommendation algorithm based on machine learning requires user data to learn user preferences. In order to protect user privacy, a lot of recent works turn to develop federated learning-based recommendation algorithms. However, some of these works can only protect the users’ rating values, some can only protect the users’ rating behavior (i.e., the engaged items), and only a few works can protect the both types of privacy at the same time. Moreover, most of them can only be applied to a specific algorithm or a class of similar algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generic cross-user federated recommendation framework called FR-FMSS. Our FR-FMSS can not only protect the two types of user privacy, but can also be applied to most recommendation algorithms for rating prediction, item ranking, and sequential recommendation. Specifically, we use fake marks and secret sharing to modify the data uploaded by the clients to the server, which protects user privacy without loss of model accuracy. We take three representative recommendation algorithms, i.e., MF-MPC, eALS, and Fossil, as examples to show how to apply our FR-FMSS to a specific algorithm.},

abstract = {Generative retrieval for search and recommendation is a promising paradigm for retrieving items, offering an alternative to traditional methods that depend on external indexes and nearest-neighbor searches. Instead, generative models directly associate inputs with item IDs. Given the breakthroughs of Large Language Models (LLMs), these generative systems can play a crucial role in centralizing a variety of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks in a single model that performs tasks such as query understanding, retrieval, recommendation, explanation, re-ranking, and response generation. Despite the growing interest in such a unified generative approach for IR systems, the advantages of using a single, multi-task model over multiple specialized models are not well established in the literature. This paper investigates whether and when such a unified approach can outperform task-specific models in the IR tasks of search and recommendation, broadly co-existing in multiple industrial online platforms, such as Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix. Previous work shows that (1) the latent representations of items learned by generative recommenders are biased towards popularity, and (2) content-based and collaborative-filtering-based information can improve an item’s representations. Motivated by this, our study is guided by two hypotheses: [H1] the joint training regularizes the estimation of each item’s popularity, and [H2] the joint training regularizes the item’s latent representations, where search captures content-based aspects of an item and recommendation captures collaborative-filtering aspects. Our extensive experiments with both simulated and real-world data support both [H1] and [H2] as key contributors to the effectiveness improvements observed in the unified search and recommendation generative models over the single-task approaches.},

abstract = {For items, the higher the click-through rate, the higher the rating. Thus, existing recommendation methods implicitly model click behaviors by learning user preferences and achieving accurate predictions on rating prediction tasks. However, they ignore the help of the rating behaviors for the click-through rate prediction task (CTR). Although the rating behavior occurs after the click behavior, we can still get helpful information about clicks from ratings. In this paper, we propose a multi-factor collaborative prediction method (MFC), which mines the complex relationship between click and rating behaviors, achieving accurate prediction on CTR tasks. Specifically, we factorize the complex relationship into three simple relationships, i.e., linear, sharing, and cross-correlation relationships. Thus, MFC first extracts click factors, rating factors, and their sharing factor from user click and rating behaviors with user reviews, as review-based methods have achieved great results on rating predictions. Then, a rating factor regularization method is used to learn rating factors accurately, helping to model the true relationships between click and rating behavior. Finally, MFC combines those three factors to make predictions, while click and rating factors are used to model the linear and cross-correlation relationships, and the sharing factors correspond to the sharing relation. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that MFC outperforms the best baseline by (9.19%), (9.80%), (0.69%), and (7.95%), in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, respectively. MFC also reduces the MAE of the rating prediction task by (1.92%). The source code is available at https://github.com/dianziliu/MFC.},

In this study, we propose a novel label inference attack specifically tailored for VFL-based recommender systems, leveraging two common characteristics: (1) item popularity often follows a power-law distribution, and (2) random negative sampling is commonly used for implicit feedback, a substitute for non-existing true labels. By combining partial local information from VFL with this prior knowledge, a malicious party can construct a semi-supervised learning pipeline. The experimental results of three real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves a higher label inference performance than the existing attacks. These findings demonstrate the need for more robust privacy preserving mechanisms in federated recommender systems.},

Our method pushes the computation of the recommendation model to the user's device, and eliminates the need to exchange sensitive personal information; instead only the loss gradients of local (device-based) MF models need to be shared. Moreover, users can select the amount and type of information to be shared, for enhanced privacy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by considering different levels of user privacy in comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel pre-trained framework for zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation without auxiliary information. While using auxiliary information (e.g.,&nbsp;item descriptions) seems promising for cross-domain transfer, a cross-domain adaptation of sequential recommenders can be challenging when the target domain differs from the source domain—item descriptions are in different languages; metadata modalities (e.g.,&nbsp;audio, image, and text) differ across source and target domains. If we can learn universal item representations independent of the domain type (e.g.,&nbsp;groceries, movies), we can achieve zero-shot cross-domain transfer without auxiliary information. Our critical insight is that user interaction sequences highlight shifting user preferences via the popularity dynamics of interacted items. We present a pre-trained sequential recommendation framework: PrepRec, which utilizes a novel popularity dynamics-aware transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, we show that PrepRec, without any auxiliary information, can zero-shot adapt to new application domains and achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommender models. In addition, we show that PrepRec&nbsp;complements existing sequential recommenders. With a simple post-hoc interpolation, PrepRec&nbsp;improves the performance of existing sequential recommenders on average by 11.8% in Recall@10 and 22% in NDCG@10. We provide an anonymized implementation of PrepRec&nbsp;at https://github.com/CrowdDynamicsLab/preprec.},

abstract = {In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommender systems have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. Nevertheless, traditional Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and BERT4Rec, while effective, encounter challenges due to the unique characteristics of music listening habits. In fact, existing models struggle to create a coherent listening experience due to rapidly evolving preferences. Moreover, music consumption is characterized by a prevalence of repeated listening, i.e. users frequently return to their favourite tracks, an important signal that could be framed as individual or personalized popularity. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach that incorporates personalized popularity information into sequential recommendation. By combining user-item popularity scores with model-generated scores, our method effectively balances the exploration of new music with the satisfaction of user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that a Personalized Most Popular recommender, a method solely based on user-specific popularity, outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, augmenting Transformer-based models with personalized popularity awareness yields superior performance, showing improvements ranging from 25.2% to 69.8%.

Traditional approaches in recommender systems algorithm selection focus predominantly on rating prediction on explicit feedback datasets, leaving a research gap for ranking prediction on implicit feedback datasets. Algorithm selection is a critical challenge for nearly every practitioner in recommender systems. In this work, we take the first steps toward addressing this research gap. We evaluate the NDCG@10 of 24 recommender systems algorithms, each with two hyperparameter configurations, on 72 recommender systems datasets. We train four optimized machine-learning meta-models and one automated machine-learning meta-model with three different settings on the resulting meta-dataset. Our results show that the predictions of all tested meta-models exhibit a median Spearman correlation ranging from 0.857 to 0.918 with the ground truth. We show that the median Spearman correlation between meta-model predictions and the ground truth increases by an average of 0.124 when the meta-model is optimized to predict the ranking of algorithms instead of their performance. Furthermore, in terms of predicting the best algorithm for an unknown dataset, we demonstrate that the best optimized traditional meta-model, e.g., XGBoost, achieves a recall of 48.6%, outperforming the best tested automated machine learning meta-model, e.g., AutoGluon, which achieves a recall of 47.2%.},

This approach has practical benefits as it centres assessment on the output of the recommender system and, therefore, measures performance from the perspective of end-users. However, this methodology neglects how recommender systems more broadly model user preferences, which is not captured by only considering the top-n recommendations. In this article, we use item response theory (IRT), a family of latent variable models used in psychometric assessment, to gain a comprehensive understanding of offline evaluation. We use IRT to jointly estimate the latent abilities of 51 recommendation algorithms and the characteristics of 3 commonly used benchmark data sets. For all data sets, the latent abilities estimated by IRT suggest that higher scores from traditional rank-based metrics do not reflect improvements in modeling user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the top-n recommendations with the most discriminatory power are biased towards lower difficulty items, leaving much room for improvement. Lastly, we highlight the role of popularity in evaluation by investigating how user engagement and item popularity influence recommendation difficulty.},

Our work addresses this issue by focusing on the replicability of results. We present a code that successfully replicates results from six popular and recent graph recommendation models (NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF) on three common benchmark datasets (Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). Additionally, we compare these graph models with traditional collaborative filtering models that historically performed well in offline evaluations. Furthermore, we extend our study to two new datasets (Allrecipes and BookCrossing) that lack established setups in existing literature. As the performance on these datasets differs from the previous benchmarks, we analyze the impact of specific dataset characteristics on recommendation accuracy. By investigating the information flow from users’ neighborhoods, we aim to identify which models are influenced by intrinsic features in the dataset structure.

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems struggle with making predictions on unseen, or ‘cold’, items. Systems designed to address this challenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to leverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction data. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods, cold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases. In this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a common cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to more popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting rarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the popularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely: because they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead attempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to significant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to popular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through experiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this behavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple post-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a proxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with limited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.},

We demonstrate using hyperbolic geometry for neural collaborative filtering in two distinct recommendation tasks based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks: top-k recommendation and explicit rating prediction. For a more comprehensive architecture, we also test SASRec. All tasks are evaluated on the Amazon Reviews and MovieLens1M datasets.

In this work, we provide a theoretical link between unconstrained and the interpretable non-negative matrix factorization in terms of the personalized ranking induced by these methods. We also introduce a novel, latent Dirichlet allocation-inspired model for recommenders and extend our theoretical link to also allow the interpretation of an unconstrained matrix factorization as an adjoint formulation of our new model. Our experiments indicate that this novel approach represents the unknown processes of implicit user-item interactions in the real world much better than unconstrained matrix factorization while being interpretable.},

abstract = {Foundation Models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced many research areas. In particular, LLMs offer significant advantages for recommender systems, making them valuable tools for personalized recommendations. For example, by formulating various recommendation tasks such as rating prediction, sequential recommendation, straightforward recommendation, and explanation generation into language instructions, LLMs make it possible to build universal recommendation engines that can handle different recommendation tasks. Additionally, LLMs have a remarkable capacity for understanding natural language, enabling them to comprehend user preferences, item descriptions, and contextual information to generate more accurate and relevant recommendations, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement. This tutorial introduces Foundation Models such as LLMs for recommendation. We will introduce how recommender system advanced from shallow models to deep models and to large models, how LLMs enable generative recommendation in contrast to traditional discriminative recommendation, and how to build LLM-based recommender systems. We will cover multiple perspectives of LLM-based recommendation, including data preparation, model design, model pre-training, fine-tuning and prompting, multi-modality and multi-task learning, as well as trustworthy perspectives of LLM-based recommender systems such as fairness and transparency.},

abstract = {The two main tasks in the Recommender Systems domain are the ranking and rating prediction tasks. The rating prediction task aims at predicting to what extent a user would like any given item, which would enable to recommend the items with the highest predicted scores. The ranking task on the other hand directly aims at recommending the most valuable items for the user. Several previous approaches proposed learning user and item representations to optimize both tasks simultaneously in a multi-task framework. In this work we propose a novel multi-task framework that exploits the fact that a user does a two-phase decision process - first decides to interact with an item (ranking task) and only afterward to rate it (rating prediction task).We evaluated our framework on two benchmark datasets, on two different configurations and showed its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {For a long time, different recommendation tasks require designing task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to transfer the knowledge and representations from one task to another, thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation approaches. To deal with such issues, considering that language can describe almost anything and language grounding is a powerful medium to represent various problems or tasks, we present a flexible and unified text-to-text paradigm called “Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Predict Paradigm” (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various recommendation tasks in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item interactions, user descriptions, item metadata, and user reviews are converted to a common format — natural language sequences. The rich information from natural language assists P5 to capture deeper semantics for personalization and recommendation. Specifically, P5 learns different tasks with the same language modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it serves as the foundation model for various downstream recommendation tasks, allows easy integration with other modalities, and enables instruction-based recommendation. P5 advances recommender systems from shallow model to deep model to big model, and will revolutionize the technical form of recommender systems towards universal recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized prompt for different users, P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or few-shot manner and largely reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On several benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of P5. To help advance future research on Recommendation as Language Processing (RLP), Personalized Foundation Models (PFM), and Universal Recommendation Engine (URE), we release the source code, dataset, prompts, and pretrained P5 model at https://github.com/jeykigung/P5.},

abstract = {Serendipity plays a pivotal role in enhancing user satisfaction within recommender systems, yet its evaluation poses significant challenges due to its inherently subjective nature and conceptual ambiguity. Current algorithmic approaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often failing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large language models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies across various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core research proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity evaluation?To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two datasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains, focusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional proxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the efficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that even the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the performance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the incorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human perspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a Pearson correlation coefficient of 21.5% when compared to the results of the user study. This research implies that LLMs may serve as potentially accurate and cost-effective evaluators, introducing a new paradigm for serendipity evaluation in recommender systems.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have been exploited as standalone recommender systems (RSs) and, more recently, as support tools for already existing RSs. A notable example of the latter is LLMRec&nbsp;[28], which prompts a LLM with the user-item data, the items’ metadata, and the candidate items generated by other multimodal RSs to obtain an augmented version of the original dataset where a final RS is trained on. While a few recent studies have proposed reproducing and rigorously evaluating LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) as standalone approaches (first research line), little to no attention has been devoted to exploring the use of LLMs as supportive components within existing RSs, particularly in the context of multimodal recommendation (second research line). To this end, in this work, we propose the first reproducibility study of a LLMs-based RS belonging to the second research line, LLMRec, in the multimodal recommendation domain. First, we try to replicate the results of LLMRec with the authors’ provided data and our own reconstructed data, outlining critical issues in the measured recommendation performance. Then, we benchmark LLMRec: (i) with unimodal and multimodal LLMs, showing how the latter may be more beneficial in a multimodal scenario; (ii) other competitive multimodal RSs, LLMs-based solutions, and an additional dataset, demonstrating inconsistencies with the trends emerging in the original paper. Finally, in an attempt to disentangle the observed performance trends, we evaluate (for the first time in the literature) the topological differences of the original user-item graph to the LLMRec’s augmented one.},

Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important. We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items. In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models.},

abstract = {News articles usually contain knowledge entities such as celebrities or organizations. Important entities in articles carry key messages and help to understand the content in a more direct way. An industrial news recommender system contains various key applications, such as personalized recommendation, item-to-item recommendation, news category classification, news popularity prediction and local news detection. We find that incorporating knowledge entities for better document understanding benefits these applications consistently. However, existing document understanding models either represent news articles without considering knowledge entities (e.g., BERT) or rely on a specific type of text encoding model (e.g., DKN) so that the generalization ability and efficiency is compromised. In this paper, we propose KRED, which is a fast and effective model to enhance arbitrary document representation with a knowledge graph. KRED first enriches entities’ embeddings by attentively aggregating information from their neighborhood in the knowledge graph. Then a context embedding layer is applied to annotate the dynamic context of different entities such as frequency, category and position. Finally, an information distillation layer aggregates the entity embeddings under the guidance of the original document representation and transforms the document vector into a new one. We advocate to optimize the model with a multi-task framework, so that different news recommendation applications can be united and useful information can be shared across different tasks. Experiments on a real-world Microsoft News dataset demonstrate that KRED greatly benefits a variety of news recommendation applications.},

abstract = {Recommender systems can significantly benefit from the availability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), which can serve as a basic mechanism for generating recommendations based on detailed user and item data, such as text descriptions, user reviews, and metadata. On the one hand, this new generation of LLM-based recommender systems paves the way for dealing with traditional limitations, such as cold-start and data sparsity. Still, on the other hand, this poses fundamental challenges for their accountability. Reproducing experiments in the new context of LLM-based recommender systems is challenging for several reasons. New approaches are published at an unprecedented pace, which makes difficult to have a clear picture of the main protocols and good practices in the experimental evaluation. Moreover, the lack of proper frameworks for LLM-based recommendation development and evaluation makes the process of benchmarking models complex and uncertain. In this work, we discuss the main issues encountered when trying to reproduce P5 (Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Prediction Paradigm), one of the first works unifying different recommendation tasks in a shared language modeling and natural language generation framework. Starting from this study, we have developed LaikaLLM, a framework for training and evaluating LLMs, specifically for the recommendation task. It has been used to perform several experiments to assess the impact of using different LLMs, different personalization strategies, and a novel set of more informative prompts on the overall performance of recommendations in a fully reproducible environment.},

The premise is that the order of interactions and sequential patterns play an essential role. Therefore, it is crucial to use datasets that exhibit a sequential structure to evaluate sequential recommenders properly. We apply several methods based on the random shuffling of the user’s sequence of interactions to assess the strength of sequential structure across 15 datasets, frequently used for sequential recommender systems evaluation in recent research papers presented at top-tier conferences. As shuffling explicitly breaks sequential dependencies inherent in datasets, we estimate the strength of sequential patterns by comparing metrics for shuffled and original versions of the dataset. Our findings show that several popular datasets have a rather weak sequential structure.},

abstract = {Sparseness of user-to-item rating data is one of the major factors that deteriorate the quality of recommender system. To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF.},

abstract = {Sequential recommender systems are becoming widespread in the online retail and streaming industry. These systems are often trained to predict the next item given a sequence of a user’s recent actions, and standard evaluation metrics reward systems that can identify the most probable items that might appear next. However, some recent papers instead evaluate recommendation systems with popularity-sampled metrics, which measure how well the model can find a user’s next item when hidden amongst generally-popular items. We argue that these popularity-sampled metrics are more appropriate for recommender systems, because the most probable items for a user often include generally-popular items. If the probability that a customer will watch Toy Story is not much more probable than for the average customer, then the movie isn’t especially relevant for them and we should not recommend it. This paper shows that optimizing popularity-sampled metrics is closely related to estimating point-wise mutual information (PMI). We propose and compare two techniques to fit PMI directly, which both improve popularity-sampled metrics for state-of-the-art recommender systems. The improvements are large compared to differences between recently-proposed model architectures.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) in real-world applications often deal with billions of user interactions daily. To capture the most recent trends effectively, it is common to update the model incrementally using only the newly arrived data. However, this may impede the model’s ability to retain long-term information due to the potential overfitting and forgetting issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adaptive Sequential Model Generation (ASMG) framework, which generates a better serving model from a sequence of historical models via a meta generator. For the design of the meta generator, we propose to employ Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to leverage its ability to capture the long-term dependencies. We further introduce some novel strategies to apply together with the GRU meta generator, which not only improve its computational efficiency but also enable more accurate sequential modeling. By instantiating the model-agnostic framework on a general deep learning-based RS model, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and one industrial dataset.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization is a well-known and effective methodology for top-k list recommendation. It became widely known during the Netflix challenge in 2006, and since then, many adapted and improved versions have been published. A particularly interesting matrix factorization algorithm called iALS (for implicit Alternating Least Squares) adapts the method for implicit feedback, i.e. a setting where only a very small amount of positive labels are available along with a majority of unknown labels. Compared to the classical task of rating prediction, learning from implicit feedback is applicable to many more domains, as the data is more abundant and requires less effort to elicit from users. However, the sparsity, imbalance, and implicit nature of the signal also pose unique challenges to retrieving the most relevant items to recommend. We revisit the role of unknown interactions in implicit matrix factorization. Traditionally, all unknowns are interpreted as negative samples and their importance in the training objective is then down-weighted to balance them out with the known, positive interactions. Interestingly, by adapting a probabilistic view of matrix factorization, we can retain the unknown nature of these interactions by modelling them as either positive or negative. With this new formulation that better fits the underlying data, we gain improved performance on the downstream recommendation task without any computational overhead compared to the popular iALS method.This paper outlines the key insights needed to adapt iALS to use logistic regression. Furthermore, a logistic version of the popular full-rank EASE model is introduced in a similar fasion. An extensive experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, a discrepancy between the need for weighting between factorization and autoencoder models is discovered, leading towards a better understanding of these methods.},

abstract = {The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems (RecSys), which often struggle to handle cold-start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM-empowered RecSys are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To thoroughly examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM-empowered RecSys, wherein adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method - Similarity-Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model-generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM-based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65% of the user-interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87% of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model’s performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical and privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-empowered RecSys. The code for reproduction is provided below: https://github.com/xuemingxxx/Attack_RecSys/},

abstract = {Recommendation system often suffers from popularity bias. Often the training data inherently exhibits long-tail distribution in item popularity (data bias). Moreover, the recommendation systems could give unfairly higher recommendation scores to popular items even among items a user equally liked, resulting in over-recommendation of popular items (model bias). In this study we propose a novel method to reduce the model bias while maintaining accuracy by directly regularizing the recommendation scores to be equal across items a user preferred. Akin to contrastive learning, we extend the widely used pairwise loss (BPR loss) which maximizes the score differences between preferred and unpreferred items, with a regularization term that minimizes the score differences within preferred and unpreferred items, respectively, thereby achieving both high debias and high accuracy performance with no additional training. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we design an experiment using a synthetic dataset which induces model bias with baseline training; we showed applying the proposed method resulted in drastic reduction of model bias while maintaining accuracy. Comprehensive comparison with earlier debias methods showed the proposed method had advantages in terms of computational validity and efficiency. Further empirical experiments utilizing four benchmark datasets and four recommendation models indicated the proposed method showed general improvements over performances of earlier debias methods. We hope that our method could help users enjoy diverse recommendations promoting serendipitous findings. Code available at https://github.com/stillpsy/popbias.},

abstract = {Fairness in the recommendation domain has recently attracted increasing attention due to more and more concerns about the algorithm discrimination and ethics. While recent years have witnessed many promising fairness aware recommender models, an important problem has been largely ignored, that is, the fairness can be biased due to the user personalized selection tendencies or the non-uniform item exposure probabilities. To study this problem, in this paper, we formally define a novel task named as unbiased fairness aware Top-N recommendation. For solving this task, we firstly define an ideal loss function based on all the user-item pairs. Considering that, in real-world datasets, only a small number of user-item interactions can be observed, we then approximate the above ideal loss with a more tractable objective based on the inverse propensity score (IPS). Since the recommendation datasets can be noisy and quite sparse, which brings difficulties for accurately estimating the IPS, we propose to optimize the objective in an IPS range instead of a specific point, which improves the model fault tolerance capability. In order to make our model more applicable to the commonly studied Top-N recommendation, we soften the ranking metrics such as Precision, Hit-Ratio, and NDCG to derive a fully differentiable framework. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model based on four real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques have already shown its strong foundation in collaborative filtering (CF), particularly for rating prediction problem. In the basic MF model, the use of additional information such as social network, item tags along with rating has become popular and effective, which results in making the model more complex. However, there are very few studies in recent years, which only use the users rating information for the recommendation. In this paper, we present a new finding on exploiting Projected User and Item Graph in the setting of Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (KPMF), which uses different graph kernels from the projected graphs. KPMF works with its latent vector spanning over all users (and items) with Gaussian process priors and tries to capture the covariance structure across users and items from their respective projected graphs. We also explore the ways of building these projected graphs to maximize the prediction accuracy. We implement the model in five real-world datasets and achieve significant performance improvement in terms of RMSE with state-of-the-art MF techniques.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have become essential in domains like streaming services, social media platforms, and e-commerce websites. However, the development of a recommender system involves a complex pipeline with preprocessing, data splitting, algorithm and model selection, and postprocessing stages. Every stage of the recommender systems pipeline requires design decisions that influence the performance of the recommender system. To ease design decisions, automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques have been adapted to the field of recommender systems, resulting in various AutoRecSys libraries. Nevertheless, these libraries limit flexibility in integrating automation techniques. In response, our research aims to enhance the usability of AutoML techniques for design decisions in recommender system pipelines. We focus on developing flexible and library-independent automation techniques for algorithm selection, model selection, and postprocessing steps. By enabling developers to make informed choices and ease the recommender system development process, we decrease the developer’s effort while improving the performance of the recommender systems. Moreover, we want to analyze the cost-to-benefit ratio of automation techniques in recommender systems, evaluating the computational overhead and the resulting improvements in predictive performance. Our objective is to leverage AutoML concepts to automate design decisions in recommender system pipelines, reduce manual effort, and enhance the overall performance and usability of recommender systems.},

abstract = {Incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization (MF) methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics (TM) to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, we first evaluate several TMs to find out which one can best predict trust scores compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. And, second, we propose to incorporate these trust scores inferred from the candidate TMs into social matrix factorization (MF). We investigate if incorporating the implicit trust scores in MF can make rating prediction as accurate as the MF on explicit trust scores. The reported results support the idea of employing implicit trust into MF whenever explicit trust is not available, since the performance of both models is similar.},

The problem is context-free in the sense that no side information about users or items is needed. We work in a continuous-time setting where each timestamp corresponds to a visit by a user and a corresponding decision regarding recommendation. The main novelty is that we model the reward distribution as a consequence of variations in the intensity of the activity, and thereby we assist the exploration/exploitation dilemma by exploring the temporal dynamics of the audience. To achieve this, we assume that the recommendation procedure can be split into two different states: the loyal and the curious state. We identify the current state by modelling the events as a mixture of two Poisson processes, one for each of the possible states. We further assume that the loyal audience is associated with a single stationary reward distribution, but each bursty period comes with its own reward distribution. We test our algorithm and compare it to several baselines in two strands of experiments: synthetic data simulations and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that BMAB achieves competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, a large number of sessions (about 19%) contain views and purchases of items that did not appear before. We propose the following approaches to overcome these problems. First, we introduce a simple, yet strong sequence-aware MLP that outperforms recently proposed sequential recommenders such as BERT4Rec and GRU4Rec in the given dataset. Secondly, we propose a similarity metric that captures not only item metadata but also item popularity. Lastly, we predict recommendations for different types of sessions with different serving models.},

abstract = {Multi-interest recommendation methods extract multiple interest vectors to represent the user comprehensively. Despite their success in the matching stage, previous works overlook the long-tail problem. This results in the model excelling at suggesting head items, while the performance for tail items, which make up more than 70% of all items, remains suboptimal. Hence, enhancing the tail item recommendation capability holds great potential for improving the performance of the multi-interest model. Through experimental analysis, we reveal that the insufficient context for embedding learning is the reason behind the underperformance of tail items. Meanwhile, we face two challenges in addressing this issue: the absence of supplementary item features and the need to maintain head item performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a CoLT module (Co-occurrence embedding enhancement for Long-Tail problem) that replaces the embedding layer of existing multi-interest frameworks. By linking co-occurring items to establish "assistance relationships", CoLT aggregates information from relevant head items into tail item embeddings and enables joint gradient updates. Experiments on three datasets show our method outperforms SOTA models by 21.86% Recall@50 and improves the Recall@50 of tail items by 14.62% on average.},

Yet there seems to be a general consensus that this criterion alone is far from being enough to assess the practical effectiveness of a recommender system. Information Retrieval metrics have started to be used to evaluate item selection and ranking rather than rating prediction, but considerable divergence remains in the adoption of such metrics by different authors. On the other hand, recommendation utility includes other key dimensions and concerns beyond accuracy, such as novelty and diversity, user engagement, and business performance. While the need for further extension, formalization, clarification and standardization of evaluation methodologies is recognized in the community, this need is still unmet for a large extent.

abstract = {Collaborative filtering algorithms attempt to predict a user's interests based on his past feedback. In real world applications, a user's feedback is often continuously collected over a long period of time. It is very common for a user's interests or an item's popularity to change over a long period of time. Therefore, the underlying recommendation algorithm should be able to adapt to such changes accordingly. However, most existing algorithms do not distinguish current and historical data when predicting the users' current interests. In this paper, we consider a new problem - online evolutionary collaborative filtering, which tracks user interests over time in order to make timely recommendations. We extended the widely used neighborhood based algorithms by incorporating temporal information and developed an incremental algorithm for updating neighborhood similarities with new data. Experiments on two real world datasets demonstrated both improved effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In today’s era of information overload, personalized news recommendation systems are crucial for connecting users with relevant content. The dynamic nature of user interests and the fleeting popularity of news articles pose significant challenges to accurate prediction. For this reason, the RecSys 2024 Challenge aims to inspire innovative solutions in this field. This study presents DIVAN (Deep-Interest Virality-Aware Network), our solution for the RecSys 2024 Challenge, combining a Deep Interest Network (DIN) for personalized user interest representation with a Virality-aware Click Predictor that utilizes temporal features to estimate click probability based on news popularity. A user-specific weight balances the influence of DIN and virality-based predictions, enhancing personalization and accuracy. Experiments on the Ekstra Bladet dataset from the Challenge demonstrate how promising DIVAN is in accuracy and beyond-accuracy performance.},

abstract = {Models for recommender systems use latent factors to explain the preferences and behaviors of users with respect to a set of items (e.g., movies, books, academic papers). Typically, the latent factors are assumed to be static and, given these factors, the observed pref- erences and behaviors of users are assumed to be generated without order. These assumptions limit the explorative and predictive capabilities of such models, since users' interests and item popularity may evolve over time. To address this, we propose dPF, a dynamic matrix factorization model based on the recent Poisson factorization model for recommendations. dPF models the time evolving latent factors with a Kalman filter and the actions with Poisson distributions. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to infer the latent factors. Finally, we demonstrate dPF on 10 years of user click data from arXiv.org, one of the largest repository of scientific papers and a formidable source of information about the behavior of scientists. Empirically we show performance improvement over both static and, more recently proposed, dynamic recommendation models. We also provide a thorough exploration of the inferred posteriors over the latent variables.},

The similarities of contextual situations are derived from the available contextually tagged users' ratings according to how similarly the contextual conditions influence the user's rating behavior.

abstract = {In 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a machine learning and data mining competition for movie rating prediction. We offered $1 million to whoever improved the accuracy of our existing system called Cinematch by 10%. We conducted this competition to find new ways to improve the recommendations we provide to our members, which is a key part of our business. However, we had to come up with a proxy question that was easier to evaluate and quantify: the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted rating. A year into the competition, the Korbell team won the first Progress Prize with an 8.43% improvement. They reported more than 2000 hours of work in order to come up with the final combination of 107 algorithms that gave them this prize. And, they gave us the source code. We looked at the two underlying algorithms with the best performance in the ensemble. To put these algorithms to use, we had to work to overcome some limitations, for instance that they were built to handle 100 million ratings, instead of the more than 5 billion that we have, and that they were not built to adapt as members added more ratings. But once we overcame those challenges, we put the two algorithms into production, where they are still used as part of our recommendation engine.You might be wondering what happened with the final Grand Prize ensemble that won the $1M two years later. This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line. We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment.This example highlights the fact that, besides improving offline metrics such as the RMSE, recommender systems need to take into account other practical issues such as scalability or deployment. In this tutorial, we go over some of those practical issues that many times are as important as the theory, if not more, in order to build an industrial-scale real-world recommender system.},

Traditional recommenders pose the problem as an optimization task where they seek to minimize the error in predicted rating for an item or predicted top-n items of interest with respect a user. However, these predictions do not often translate to a well-perceived recommendation. In this work, instead of the typical rating prediction task, we predict the amount of interaction an item would receive through a social network. In particular, we propose a simple and efficient model to generate a ranked list of tweets of a user in the order of expected user interaction that they would receive on Twitter, which is expressed in terms of retweets and favorites. We evaluate our proposed model on an extended version of the MovieTweetings dataset, which contains tweets that are generated when users rate movies on IMDb (using the IMDb iOS app), and show that the proposed model performs better compared to the baselines.},

abstract = {An approach to user-based collaborative filtering is proposed that refines prediction of item ratings that is based on global user similarity by incorporating information derived from a more detailed user comparison made on the basis of Rated Item Pools (RIPs). The preference spectrum defined by items that a user has rated, and ranging from best-liked to most disliked items, is divided into item sets, or RIPs, which supply the basis for a fine-grained calculation of similarity between users. The RIP-based approach makes it possible for the model to take advantage of user tastes that are matched at one end of the spectrum, e.g., two users agree on favorites, without requiring complete correspondence of item ratings between user profiles. The approach improves rating prediction, as compared to a baseline that uses the global user similarity alone. It does not unduly inflate computational complexity or rely on external resources, common shortcomings of competing rating prediction methods. Cases in which the nearest neighbors are relatively dissimilar, known to be challenging for user-based collaborative filtering, demonstrate particularly substantial improvement. Performance is shown to be stable across the choice of neighborhood size, number of pools and relative pool size.},

Recent work suggests that many recommenders tend to provide miscalibrated recommendations. Furthermore, most approaches aimed at improving calibration adopt the post-processing paradigm, making them computationally costly at the inference time. This work proposes CaliTune, a fine-tuning approach applied to collaborative filtering based recommenders to allow them generate better calibrated recommendations without relying on costly post-processing. We compare CaliTune to an established post-processing approach on two backbone models and datasets from movie and music domains, focusing on popularity calibration. Our results suggest that CaliTune can offer a competitive accuracy–calibration trade-off in several settings, particularly when the backbone model exhibits high miscalibration and accuracy remains important, making it a promising inference-efficient alternative in such cases.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix factorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information. The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can be applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3) publicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be collectively utilized to fully leverage public data. Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between private models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints become more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for recommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.},

The library offers state-of-the-art algorithms for those two tasks. Programs that expose most of the library's functionality, plus a GUI demo, are included in the package. Efficient data structures and a common API are used by the implemented algorithms, and may be used to implement further algorithms.

abstract = {Subjective features of content items, such as emotional resonance and aesthetic quality, have become increasingly important in recommender systems (RecSys), as the field moves beyond objective content and behavioral signals. Traditionally, such features were treated as fixed item-level properties, aggregated across users. However, emerging evidence suggests that subjective features are inherently user-dependent, shaped by individual interpretations and personal perspectives. This paper presents the first direct comparison between fixed (aggregated) and user-specific (subjective) item representations for modeling subjective features in RecSys. Using three datasets spanning movies, videos, and images, with subjective features, such as eudaimonia, hedonia, emotion, and aesthetics, we evaluate the impact of the representation strategy (i.e. fixed vs. user-specific) on recommendation performance across multiple algorithms. Our findings show that user-specific representations consistently outperform aggregate ones, often with statistically significant improvements. These results underscore the importance of modeling subjectivity at the user level, offering concrete guidance for more personalized and effective recommendation systems.},

However, many existing food recommendation systems have overlooked the important aspect of healthy-food and nutritional value of recommended foods, thereby limiting their effectiveness in generating truly healthy recommendations. Our preliminary analysis indicates that users tend to respond positively to unhealthy food and recipes. As a result, existing food recommender systems that neglect health considerations often assign high scores to popular items, inadvertently encouraging unhealthy choices among users. In this study, we propose the development of a fairness-based model that prioritizes health considerations. Our model incorporates fairness constraints from both the user and item perspectives, integrating them into a joint objective framework. Experimental results conducted on real-world food datasets demonstrate that the proposed system not only maintains the ability of food recommendation systems to suggest users’ favorite foods but also improves the health factor compared to unfair models, with an average enhancement of approximately 35%.},

abstract = {Recommender systems evaluation has evolved rapidly in recent years. However, for offline evaluation, accuracy is the de facto standard for assessing the superiority of one method over another, with most research comparisons focused on tasks ranging from rating prediction to ranking metrics for top-n recommendation. Simultaneously, recommendation diversity and novelty have become recognized as critical to users’ perceived utility, with several new metrics recently proposed for evaluating these aspects of recommendation lists. Consequently, the accuracy-diversity dilemma frequently shows up as a choice to make when creating new recommendation algorithms. We propose a novel adaptation of a unified metric, derived from one commonly used for search system evaluation, to Recommender Systems. The proposed metric combines topical diversity and accuracy, and we show it to satisfy a set of desired properties that we formulate axiomatically. These axioms are defined as fundamental constraints that a good unified metric should always satisfy. Moreover, beyond the axiomatic analysis, we present an experimental evaluation of the metric with collaborative filtering data. Our analysis shows that the metric respects the desired theoretical constraints and behaves as expected when performing offline evaluation.},

Trust relationships in particular can be exploited in such systems for rating prediction and recommendation, which has been shown to have the potential for improving the quality of the recommender and alleviating the issue of data sparsity, cold start, and adversarial attacks. An appropriate trust inference mechanism is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackling the issue of limited trust information due to connection sparsity of social networks. In this work, we offer a new solution to trust inference in social networks to provide a better knowledge base for trust-aware recommender systems. We propose using a semiring framework as a nonlinear way to combine trust evidences for inferring trust, where trust relationship is model as 2-D vector containing both trust and certainty information. The trust propagation and aggregation rules, as the building blocks of our trust inference scheme, are based upon the properties of trust relationships. In our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are considered, and opinion conflict resolution is supported. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and show that our trust inference framework has high accuracy, and is capable of handling trust relationship in large networks. The inferred trust relationships can enlarge the knowledge base for trust information and improve the quality of trust-aware recommendation.},

In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs), which are nowadays introducing disruptive effects in many AI-based applications, can be used to build or improve sequential recommendation approaches. Specifically, we devise and evaluate three approaches to leverage the power of LLMs in different ways. Our results from experiments on two datasets show that initializing the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model BERT4Rec with embeddings obtained from an LLM improves NDCG by 15-20% compared to the vanilla BERT4Rec model. Furthermore, we find that a simple approach that leverages LLM embeddings for producing recommendations, can provide competitive performance by highlighting semantically related items. We publicly share the code and data of our experiments to ensure reproducibility.1},

The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of the many possible approaches to recommendations.In this tutorial we will describe different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. We will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recommender system that has evolved from focusing on rating prediction to full page optimization. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include algorithms such as Factorization Machines [9], Restricted Boltzmann Machines [10], SimRank [7], Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank [6, 12, 11].The original recommendation problem was formulated around the existence of explicit user ratings. However, recommender systems can be built using different kinds of data including implicit behavioral data, social connections, or demographics. In this tutorial we will review the usage of different data types and discuss what the availability of Big Data has brought into the research area.Finally, and also related to the availability of large quantities of data, we will talk about how system and architectural decisions play a role in understanding the recommender problem.This tutorial is in part based on recent publications by the author [5, 1, 8, 2, 4, 3].},

abstract = {Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation. As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.},

abstract = {Evaluation have been an important subject since the early days of recommender systems. In online test, the click-through rate (CTR) is often adopted as the metric. However, recommended items with higher CTR does not imply higher relevance of two items since factors like item popularity or item serendipity may influence user's click behavior. We argue that the relevance of recommendation system is also desirable in many real applications. Here relevant means relevance in a human perceptible way. Relevant recommendations not only increase the users' trust to the system but are extremely useful for the vast number of anonymous user as their recommendations may only be made based on the current item. In this paper, we empirically examine the relation between the relevance of recommendations and the corresponding CTR with a few representative ItemCF algorithms through online data from a TV show/movie website, Hulu. Experiments show that algorithms with higher overall CTR may not correspond to higher relevance. Thus CTR may not be the optimal metric for online evaluation of recommender systems if producing relevant recommendations is of importance.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing availability of online social networks and the well-known effect of social influence have motivated research on social-network based recommenders. Social influence and selection together lead to the formation of communities of like-minded and well connected users. Exploiting the clustering of users and items is one of the most important approaches for model-based recommendation. Users may belong to multiple communities or groups, but only a few clustering algorithms allow clusters to overlap. One of these algorithms is the probabilistic EM clustering method, which assumes that data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian models. The mixed membership stochastic block model (MMB) transfers the idea of EM clustering from conventional, non-relational data to social network data. In this paper, we introduce a generalized stochastic blockmodel (GSBM) that models not only the social relations but also the rating behavior. This model learns the mixed group membership assignments for both users and items in an SRN. GSBM can predict the future behavior of users, both the rating of items and creation of links to other users. We performed experiments on two real life datasets from Epinions.com and Flixster.com, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed GSBM for rating prediction as well as link prediction.},

abstract = {In sparse recommender settings, users’ context and item attributes play a crucial role in deciding which items to recommend next. Despite that, recent works in sequential and time-aware recommendations usually either ignore both aspects or only consider one of them, limiting their predictive performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a context and attribute-aware recommender model (CARCA) that can capture the dynamic nature of the user profiles in terms of contextual features and item attributes via dedicated multi-head self-attention blocks that extract profile-level features and predict item scores. Also, unlike many of the current state-of-the-art sequential item recommendation approaches that use a simple dot-product between the most recent item’s latent features and the target items embeddings for scoring, CARCA uses cross-attention between all profile items and the target items to predict their final scores. This cross-attention allows CARCA to harness the correlation between old and recent items in the user profile and their influence on deciding which item to recommend next. Experiments on four real-world recommender system datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of item recommendation and achieving improvements of up to 53% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit-Ratio. Results also show that CARCA outperformed several state-of-the-art dedicated image-based recommender systems by merely utilizing image attributes extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 in a black-box fashion.},

The task aims to predict which articles users are likely to click on from a list of candidate articles, by leveraging users’ browsing history, personal information, article details, and session information. Our approach is centered around a LightGBM Ranker model. Various features were used, including user, article, and session information, as well as their interactions. Additionally, embeddings were created from users’ browsing history and news article texts, and their cosine similarities were used as additional features. Appropriate validating methods using time series were explored, and effective data sampling and ensemble methods were also proposed to fit the data within limited memory. Finally, the final model was created by performing a weighted ensemble using multiple periods and random seeds. This method achieved high performance with AUC of 0.8169. As a result, an 8th place finish was achieved among around 200 participating teams. The code is available at https://github.com/tetsuro731/RecSys-Challenge-2024-tetsuro731.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are known to exhibit fairness issues, particularly on the product side, where products and their associated suppliers receive unequal exposure in recommended results. While this problem has been widely studied in traditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation (BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional complexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user satisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and the individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics designed for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this multi-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world datasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods. We analyze exposure disparities at both the bundle and item levels using multiple fairness metrics, uncovering important patterns. Our results show that exposure patterns differ notably between bundles and items, revealing the need for fairness interventions that go beyond bundle-level assumptions. We also find that fairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used, reinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation. Furthermore, user behavior plays a critical role: when users interact more frequently with bundles than with individual items, BR systems tend to yield fairer exposure distributions across both levels. Overall, our findings offer actionable insights for building fairer bundle recommender systems and establish a vital foundation for future research in this emerging domain.},

Our results show that papers using deep learning algorithms emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional methods.

abstract = {Modern recommender systems usually include separate recommendation carousels such as ‘trending now’ to list trending items and further boost their popularity, thereby attracting active users. Though widely useful, such ‘trending now’ carousels typically generate item lists based on simple heuristics, e.g., the number of interactions within a time interval, and therefore still leave much room for improvement. This paper aims to systematically study this under-explored but important problem from the new perspective of time series forecasting. We first provide a set of rigorous definitions related to item trendiness and formulate the trend recommendation task as a one-step time series forecasting problem. We then propose a deep latent variable model, dubbed Trend Recommender (TrendRec), to forecast items’ future trends and generate trending item lists. Furthermore, we design associated evaluation protocols for trend recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets from various domains show that our TrendRec significantly outperforms the baselines, verifying our model’s effectiveness.},

abstract = {Rating sparsity is a critical issue for collaborative filtering. For example, the well-known Netflix Movie rating data contain ratings of only about 1% user-item pairs. One way to address this rating sparsity problem is to develop more effective methods for training rating prediction models. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a collective training paradigm to automatically and effectively augment the training ratings. Essentially, the collective training paradigm builds multiple different Collaborative Filtering (CF) models separately, and augments the training ratings of each CF model by using the partial predictions of other CF models for unknown ratings. Along this line, we develop two algorithms, Bi-CF and Tri-CF, based on collective training. For Bi-CF and Tri-CF, we collectively and iteratively train two and three different CF models via iteratively augmenting training ratings for individual CF model. We also design different criteria to guide the selection of augmented training ratings for Bi-CF and Tri-CF. Finally, the experimental results show that Bi-CF and Tri-CF algorithms can significantly outperform baseline methods, such as neighborhood-based and SVD-based models.},

Many of the recent algorithms rely on sophisticated methods which are based, for instance, on matrix factorization techniques or advanced probabilistic models and/or require a computationally intensive model-building phase. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of a new and extremely simple prediction method (RF-Rec) that uses the user's and the item's most frequent rating value to make a rating prediction. The evaluation on three standard test data sets shows that the accuracy of the algorithm is on a par with the standard collaborative filtering algorithms on dense data sets and outperforms them on sparse rating databases. At the same time, the algorithm's implementation is trivial, has a high prediction coverage, requires no complex offline pre-processing or model-building phase and can generate predictions in constant time.},

abstract = {User data scarcity has always been indicated among the major problems of collaborative filtering recommender systems. That is, if two users do not share sufficiently large set of items for whom their ratings are known, then the user-to-user similarity computation is not reliable and a rating prediction for one user can not be based on the ratings of the other. This paper shows that this problem can be solved, and that the accuracy of collaborative recommendations can be improved by: a) partitioning the collaborative user data into specialized and distributed repositories, and b) aggregating information coming from these repositories. This paper explores a content-dependent partitioning of collaborative movie ratings, where the ratings are partitioned according to the genre of the movie and presents an evaluation of four aggregation approaches. The evaluation demonstrates that the aggregation improves the accuracy of a centralized system containing the same ratings and proves the feasibility and advantages of a distributed collaborative filtering scenario.},

abstract = {This paper is about the utility of making personalized recommendations. While it is important to accurately predict the target user's preference, in practice the accuracy should not be the only concern; a useful recommender system needs to consider the user's utility or satisfaction of fulfilling a certain information seeking task. For example, recommending popular items (products) is unlikely to result in more gain than discovering insignificant ("long tail") yet liked items because the popular ones might be already known to the user. Equally, recommending items that are out of stock would be frustrating for both the user and system if the system is employed to discover items to purchase. Thus, it is important to have a flexible recommendation framework that takes into account additional recommendation goals meanwhile minimizing the performance loss in order to provide greater adjustability and a better user experience.To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a general recommendation optimization framework that not only considers the predicted preference scores (e.g. ratings) but also deals with additional operational or resource related recommendation goals. Using this framework we demonstrate through realistic examples how to expand existing rating prediction algorithms by biasing the recommendation depending on other external factors such as the availability, profitability or usefulness of an item. Our experiments on real data sets demonstrate that this framework is indeed able to cope with multiple objectives with minor performance loss.},

While LensKit offers a wide variety of features, it does not include any optimization strategies or guidelines on how to select and tune LensKit algorithms. LensKit developers have to manually include third-party libraries into their experimental setup or implement optimization strategies by hand to optimize hyperparameters. We found that 63.6% (21 out of 33) of papers using LensKit algorithms for their experiments did not select algorithms or tune hyperparameters. Non-optimized models represent poor baselines and produce less meaningful research results. This demo introduces LensKit-Auto.

abstract = {Collaborative filtering has been a dominant approach in the recommender systems community since the early 1990s. Collaborative filtering (and other) algorithms, however, have been predominantly evaluated by aggregating results across users or user groups. These performance averages hide large disparities: an algorithm may perform very well for some users (or groups) and poorly for others. We show that performance variation is large and systematic. In experiments on three large-scale datasets and using an array of collaborative filtering algorithms, we demonstrate large performance disparities across algorithms, datasets and metrics for different users. We then show that two key features that characterize users, their mean taste similarity and dispersion in taste similarity with other users, can systematically explain performance variation better than previously identified features. We use these two features to visualize algorithm performance for different users and we point out that this mapping can capture different categories of users that have been proposed before. Our results demonstrate an extensive mainstream-taste bias in collaborative filtering algorithms, which implies a fundamental fairness limitation that needs to be mitigated.},

abstract = {One way to increase trust among users towards recommender systems is to provide the recommendation along with a textual explanation. In the literature, extraction-based, generation-based, and, more recently, hybrid solutions based on retrieval-augmented generation have been proposed to tackle the problem of text-based explainable recommendation. However, the use of different datasets, preprocessing steps, target explanations, baselines, and evaluation metrics complicates the reproducibility and state-of-the-art assessment of previous work among different model categories for successful advancements in the field. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of text-based explainable recommender systems by setting up a well-defined benchmark that accommodates generation-based, extraction-based, and hybrid approaches. Also, we enrich the existing evaluation of explainability and text quality of the explanations with a novel definition of feature hallucination. Our experiments on three real-world datasets unveil hidden behaviors and confirm several claims about model patterns.

abstract = {Most recommender systems (RecSys) do not provide an indication of confidence in their decisions. Therefore, they do not distinguish between recommendations of which they are certain, and those where they are not. Existing confidence methods for RecSys are either inaccurate heuristics, conceptually complex or computationally very expensive. Consequently, real-world RecSys applications rarely adopt these methods, and thus, provide no confidence insights in their behavior. In this work, we propose learned beta distributions (LBD) as a simple and practical recommendation method with an explicit measure of confidence. Our main insight is that beta distributions predict user preferences as probability distributions that naturally model confidence on a closed interval, yet can be implemented with the minimal model-complexity. Our results show that LBD maintains competitive accuracy to existing methods while also having a significantly stronger correlation between its accuracy and confidence. Furthermore, LBD has higher performance when applied to a high-precision targeted recommendation task. Our work thus shows that confidence in RecSys is possible without sacrificing simplicity or accuracy, and without introducing heavy computational complexity. Thereby, we hope it enables better insight into real-world RecSys and opens the door for novel future applications.},

However, most of existing works merely focus on the correlations between user preferences and predicted items, ignoring the essential correlations among items in the next basket, which often results in over-homogenization of predicted items. In this work, we presents a Generative next-basket Recommendation model (GenRec), a novel NBR paradigm that generates the recommended items one by one to form the next basket via an autoregressive decoder. This generative NBR paradigm contributes to capturing and considering item correlations inside each baskets in both training and serving. Moreover, we jointly consider user’s both item- and basket-level contextual information to better capture user’s multi-granularity preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

abstract = {In this technical report, we present our solution of RecSys Challenge 2022 focusing on the fashion recommendation. We produce recommendations in two steps: (i) the retrieval step, which generates a candidate item set based on multiple cheap-to-compute strategies; (ii) the ranking step: which rearranges the candidate items with a richer set of features. Specifically, we conduct various strategies to retrieve as many positive samples as possible in retrieval step and obtain the retrieval scores from these retrieval channels meanwhile. Then these scores along with some extracted features are involved in the ranking stage for modeling to generate the purchase prediction. In the final submission, we use six effective retrieval strategies in retrieval step and ensemble five ranking models by taking average of their outputs. Using our method, our team doubleQ achieved MRR 0.2013 on final test set which wins the 10 place, and the solution codes are available via https://github.com/doubleQ2018/recsys-challenge-2022.},

abstract = {Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item by mining out the dynamic preference from user previous interactions. However, most methods represent each item as a single fixed vector, which is incapable of capturing the uncertainty of item-item transitions that result from time-dependent and multifarious interests of users. Besides, they struggle to effectively exploit side information that helps to better express user preferences. Finally, the noise in user’s access sequence, which is due to accidental clicks, can interfere with the next item prediction and lead to lower recommendation performance. To deal with these issues, we propose DLFS-Rec, a simple and novel model that combines Distribution-based Learnable Filters with Side information for sequential Recommendation. Specifically, items and their side information are represented by stochastic Gaussian distribution, which is described by mean and covariance embeddings, and then the corresponding embeddings are fused to generate a final representation for each item. To attenuate noise, stacked learnable filter layers are applied to smooth the fused embeddings. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start users and items. Codes are available at https://github.com/zxiang30/DLFS-Rec.},

The ACM RecSys Challenge 2025 addressed this by proposing a unified task to create generalizable user profiles from a large-scale behavioral dataset provided by Synerise. This paper presents the 4th-place solution in the academic track from team "ririka". Our approach centers on creating a powerful, hybrid Universal Behavioral Profile by fusing an extensive, feature-engineered vector with multiple specialized embeddings from a Universal Behavioral Transformer (UBT). We introduce a comprehensive feature engineering strategy incorporating statistical, temporal, and semantic features, and develop a multi-task UBT framework to generate distinct embeddings for objectives like churn and propensity. Through a meticulous fusion and normalization methodology, we combine these components into a single, high-dimensional user representation. Our final model proved highly effective, demonstrating robust and generalizable performance across both open and hidden evaluation tasks. Our analysis confirms that synthesizing handcrafted features with deep, sequential representations is critical for building a powerful and versatile user profile.},

abstract = {Popularity bias is a prominent phenomenon in recommender systems (RS), especially in the music domain. Although popularity bias mitigation techniques are known to enhance the fairness of RS while maintaining their high performance, there is a lack of understanding regarding users’ actual perception of the suggested music. To address this gap, we conducted a user study (n=40) exploring user satisfaction and perception of personalized music recommendations generated by algorithms that explicitly mitigate popularity bias. Specifically, we investigate item-centered and user-centered bias mitigation techniques, aiming to ensure fairness for artists or users, respectively. Results show that neither mitigation technique harms the users’ satisfaction with the recommendation lists despite promoting underrepresented items. However, the item-centered mitigation technique impacts user perception; by promoting less popular items, it reduces users’ familiarity with the items. Lower familiarity evokes discovery—the feeling that the recommendations enrich the user’s taste. We demonstrate that this can ultimately lead to higher satisfaction, highlighting the potential of less-popular recommendations to improve the user experience.},

abstract = {Scaling of neural networks has recently shown great potential to improve the model capacity in various fields. Specifically, model performance has a power-law relationship with model size or data size, which provides important guidance for the development of large-scale models. However, there is still limited understanding on the scaling effect of user behavior models in recommender systems, where the unique data characteristics (e.g., data scarcity and sparsity) pose new challenges in recommendation tasks. In this work, we focus on investigating the scaling laws in large sequential recommendation models. Specifically, we consider a pure ID-based task formulation, where the interaction history of a user is formatted as a chronological sequence of item IDs. We don’t incorporate any side information (e.g., item text), to delve into the scaling law’s applicability from the perspective of user behavior. We successfully scale up the model size to 0.8B parameters, making it feasible to explore the scaling effect in a diverse range of model sizes. As the major findings, we empirically show that the scaling law still holds for these trained models, even in data-constrained scenarios. We then fit the curve for scaling law, and successfully predict the test loss of the two largest tested model scales. Furthermore, we examine the performance advantage of scaling effect on five challenging recommendation tasks, considering the unique issues (e.g., cold start, robustness, long-term preference) in recommender systems. We find that scaling up the model size can greatly boost the performance on these challenging tasks, which again verifies the benefits of large recommendation models.},

This paper addresses this challenge by evaluating the effectiveness of context-aware models and calibrated popularity techniques as strategies for mitigating popularity bias. Using four real-world POI datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare, Gowalla, and Yelp), we analyze the individual and combined effects of these approaches on recommendation accuracy and popularity bias. Our results reveal that context-aware models cannot be considered a uniform solution, as the models studied exhibit divergent impacts on accuracy and bias. In contrast, calibration techniques can effectively align recommendation popularity with user preferences, provided there is a careful balance between accuracy and bias mitigation. Notably, the combination of calibration and context-awareness yields recommendations that balance accuracy and close alignment with the users’ popularity profiles, i.e., popularity calibration.},

abstract = {Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite -- avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start "no-positive-feedback" scenarios.},

abstract = {Many recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in their output: popular items are recommended frequently and less popular ones rarely, if at all. However, less popular, long-tail items are precisely those that are often desirable recommendations. In this paper, we introduce a flexible regularization-based framework to enhance the long-tail coverage of recommendation lists in a learning-to-rank algorithm. We show that regularization provides a tunable mechanism for controlling the trade-off between accuracy and coverage. Moreover, the experimental results using two data sets show that it is possible to improve coverage of long tail items without substantial loss of ranking performance.},

abstract = {Multi-agent collaboration is the latest trending method to build conversational recommender systems (CRS), especially with the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) recently. Typically, these systems employ several LLM agents, each serving distinct roles to meet user needs. In an industrial setting, it’s essential for a CRS to exhibit low first token latency (i.e., the time taken from a user’s input until the system outputs its first response token.) and high scalability—for instance, minimizing the number of LLM inferences per user request—to enhance user experience and boost platform profit. For example, JD.com’s baseline CRS features two LLM agents and a search API but suffers from high first token latency and requires two LLM inferences per request (LIPR), hindering its performance. To address these issues, we introduce a Hybrid Multi-Agent Collaborative Recommender System (Hybrid-MACRS). It includes a central agent powered by a fine-tuned proprietary LLM and a search agent combining a related search module with a search engine. This hybrid system notably reduces first token latency by about 70% and cuts the LIPR from 2 to 1. We conducted thorough online A/B testing to confirm this approach’s efficiency.},

abstract = {Nowadays a recommendation model should exploit additional information from both the user and item perspectives, in addition to utilizing user-item interaction data. Datasets are central in offering the required information for evaluating new models or algorithms. Although there are many datasets in the literature with user and item properties, there are several issues not covered yet: (i) it is difficult to perform cross-analysis of properties at user and item level as they are not related in most cases; and (ii) on top of that, in many occasions datasets do not allow analysis at different granularity levels. In this paper, we propose a new dataset in the music domain, named AMBAR, that tackles the above-mentioned issues. Besides detailing in depth the structure of the new dataset, we also show its application in contexts (i.e., multi-objective, fair, and calibrated recommendations) where both the effectiveness and the beyond-accuracy perspectives of recommendation are assessed.},

abstract = {Despite their proven various benefits, Recommender Systems can cause or amplify certain undesired effects. In this paper, we focus on Popularity Bias, i.e., the tendency of a recommender system to utilize the effect of recommending popular items to the user. Prior research has studied the negative impact of this type of bias on individuals and society as a whole and proposed various approaches to mitigate this in various domains. However, almost all works adopted offline methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Unfortunately, such offline simulations can potentially be rather simplified and unable to capture the full picture. To contribute to this line of research and given a particular lack of knowledge about how debiasing approaches work not only offline, but online as well, we present in this paper the results of user study on a national broadcaster movie streaming platform in Norway, i.e., TV 2, following the A/B testing methodology. We deployed an effective mitigation approach for popularity bias, called Calibrated Popularity (CP), and monitored its performance in comparison to the platform’s existing collaborative filtering recommendation approach as a baseline over a period of almost four months. The results obtained from a large user base interacting in real-time with the recommendations indicate that the evaluated debiasing approach can be effective in addressing popularity bias while still maintaining the level of user interest and engagement.},

This budget is, in turn, increased by accurately predicting local content popularity. One of the key goals of our mechanism is to encourage ratings, and in an evaluation of the live system we found that the rating to click ratio was 107 times higher than the ratio for videos on YouTube, 34 times higher than the ratio for applications on the Android Market, and 3 times higher than the ratio for Web pages on Digg.To investigate whether our mechanism also had qualitative effects on the ratings we conducted a number of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with 500 users, comparing our mechanism to the de-facto 5-star ratings commonly in use on the Web. Our results show that budgets improved the ranking and incentives improved the aggregate rating of a series of location-dependent Web pages.},

The composition and order of these “carousels” are usually optimized by simulating user interaction based on probabilistic models learned from item click data. Research that actually involves users is rare, with only few studies investigating general user experience in comparison to conventional recommendation lists. Hence, it is largely unknown how specific design aspects such as carousel type and length influence the individual perception and usage of carousel-based interfaces. This paper seeks to fill this gap through an exploratory user study. The results confirm previous assumptions about user behavior and provide first insights into the differences in decision making in the presence of multiple recommendation carousels.},

abstract = {A recommender system operates in a dynamic environment where new items emerge and new users join the system, resulting in ever-growing user-item interactions over time. Existing works either assume a model trained offline on a static dataset (requiring periodic re-training with ever larger datasets); or an online learning setup that favors recency over history. As privacy-aware users could hide their histories, the loss of older information means that periodic retraining may not always be feasible, while online learning may lose sight of users’ long-term preferences. In this work, we adopt a continual learning perspective to collaborative filtering, by compartmentalizing users and items over time into a notion of tasks. Of particular concern is to mitigate catastrophic forgetting that occurs when the model would reduce performance for older users and items in prior tasks even as it tries to fit the newer users and items in the current task. To alleviate this, we propose a method that leverages gradient alignment to deliver a model that is more compatible across tasks and maximizes user agreement for better user representations to improve long-term recommendations.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a core component of popular web-based services such as Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, and Twitter. Most applications use CF to recommend a small set of items to the user. For instance, YouTube presents to a user a list of top-n videos she would likely watch next based on her rating and viewing history. Current methods of CF evaluation have been focused on assessing the quality of a predicted rating or the ranking performance for top-n recommended items. However, restricting the recommender system evaluation to these two aspects is rather limiting and neglects other dimensions that could better characterize a well-perceived recommendation. In this paper, instead of optimizing rating or top-n recommendation, we focus on the task of predicting which items generate the highest user engagement. In particular, we use Twitter as our testbed and cast the problem as a Collaborative Ranking task where the rich features extracted from the metadata of the tweets help to complement the transaction information limited to user ids, item ids, ratings and timestamps. We learn a scoring function that directly optimizes the user engagement in terms of nDCG@10 on the predicted ranking. Experiments conducted on an extended version of the MovieTweetings dataset, released as part of the RecSys Challenge 2014, show the effectiveness of our approach.},

This paper aims to conduct rigorous (i.e., reproducible and fair) evaluation for implicit-feedback based top-N recommendation algorithms. We first systematically review 85 recommendation papers published at eight top-tier conferences (e.g., RecSys, SIGIR) to summarize important evaluation factors, e.g., data splitting and parameter tuning strategies, etc. Through a holistic empirical study, the impacts of different factors on recommendation performance are then analyzed in-depth. Following that, we create benchmarks with standardized procedures and provide the performance of seven well-tuned state-of-the-arts across six metrics on six widely-used datasets as a reference for later study. Additionally, we release a user-friendly Python toolkit, which differs from existing ones in addressing the broad scope of rigorous evaluation for recommendation. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation and lays the foundation for further investigation.

abstract = {Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation. Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust offline comparisons.},

Historical critiquing methods were largely based on constraint- and utility-based methods for modifying recommendations w.r.t. these critiqued attributes. In this paper, we revisit the critiquing approach from the lens of deep learning based recommendation methods and language-based interaction. Concretely, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework with two variants that extend the Neural Collaborative Filtering architecture with explanation and critiquing components. These architectures not only predict personalized keyphrases for a user and item but also embed language-based feedback in the latent space that in turn modulates subsequent critiqued recommendations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results show that our modified NCF approach not only provides a strong baseline recommender and high-quality personalized item keyphrase suggestions, but that it also properly suppresses items predicted to have a critiqued keyphrase. In summary, this paper provides a first step to unify deep recommendation and language-based feedback in what we hope to be a rich space for future research in deep critiquing for conversational recommendation.},

In a social graph scenario, user-user trust plays a significant role in reducing sparsity and has varied characteristics that can be exploited. Existing models limit themselves to learning from either a high-order interaction graph of user-item ratings or a user-user social graph from trust value. They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques. Incorporating graph based model with matrix factorization brings its own set of challenges of model integration, leveraging trust, graph learning, and optimization.

abstract = {Recently there has been a growing interest in fairness-aware recommender systems including fairness in providing consistent performance across different users or groups of users. A recommender system could be considered unfair if the recommendations do not fairly represent the tastes of a certain group of users while other groups receive recommendations that are consistent with their preferences. In this paper, we use a metric called miscalibration for measuring how a recommendation algorithm is responsive to users’ true preferences and we consider how various algorithms may result in different degrees of miscalibration for different users. In particular, we conjecture that popularity bias which is a well-known phenomenon in recommendation is one important factor leading to miscalibration in recommendation. Our experimental results using two real-world datasets show that there is a connection between how different user groups are affected by algorithmic popularity bias and their level of interest in popular items. Moreover, we show that the more a group is affected by the algorithmic popularity bias, the more their recommendations are miscalibrated.},

abstract = {At the present time, sequential item recommendation models are compared by calculating metrics on a small item subset (target set) to speed up computation. The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative items that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to sample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to better approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most recently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by popularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already shown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent with the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a metric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether the ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In this work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender models from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact on the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed sequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each dataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies. First, we compute the full model ranking. Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the two different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model ranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we vary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling strategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of the models. Furthermore, both sampling by popularity and uniform random sampling do not consistently produce the same ranking when compared over different sample sizes. Our results suggest that like uniform random sampling, rankings obtained by sampling by popularity do not equal the full ranking of recommender models and therefore both should be avoided in favor of the full ranking when establishing state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Trust-based recommender systems emerged as a solution to different limitations of traditional recommender systems. These social systems rely on the assumption that users will adopt the preferences of users they deem trustworthy in an online social setting. However, most trust-based recommender systems consider trust to be a static notion, thereby disregarding crucial dynamic factors that influence the value of trust between users and the performance of the recommender system. In this work, we intend to address several challenges regarding the dynamics of trust within a social recommender system. These issues include the temporal evolution of trust between users and change detection and prediction in users’ interactions. By exploring the factors that influence the evolution of human trust, a complex and abstract concept, this work will contribute to a better understanding of how trust operates in recommender systems.},

abstract = {At present, most recommender systems involve two stakeholders, providers and customers. Apart from maximizing the recommendation accuracy, the fairness issue for both sides should also be considered. Most of previous studies try to improve two-sided fairness with post-processing algorithms or fairness-aware loss constraints, which are highly dependent on the heuristic adjustments without respect to the optimization goal of accuracy. In contrast, we propose a novel training framework, adaptive weighting towards two-sided fairness-aware recommendation&nbsp;(named Ada2Fair), which lies in the extension of the accuracy-focused objective to a controllable preference learning loss over the interaction data. Specifically, we adjust the optimization scale of an interaction sample with an adaptive weight generator, and estimate the two-sided fairness-aware weights within model training. During the training process, the recommender is trained with two-sided fairness-aware weights to boost the utility of niche providers and inactive customers in a unified way. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of&nbsp;Ada2Fair, which can achieve Pareto efficiency in two-sided fairness-aware recommendation.},

To this end, we are interested in developing a locally-focused artist and event recommendation system called Localify.org that supports and promotes local music scenes. In this demo paper, we describe both the overall system architecture as well as our core recommendation algorithm. This algorithm uses artist-artist similarity information, as opposed to user-artist preference information, to bootstrap recommendation while we grow the number of users. The overall design of Localify was chosen based on the fact that local artists tend to be relatively obscure and reside in the long tail of the artist popularity distribution. We discuss the role of popularity bias and how we attempt to ameliorate it in the context of local music recommendation.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are typically evaluated in an offline setting. A subset of the available user-item interactions is sampled to serve as test set, and some model trained on the remaining data points is then evaluated on its performance to predict which interactions were left out. Alternatively, in an online evaluation setting, multiple versions of the system are deployed and various metrics for those systems are recorded. Systems that score better on these metrics, are then typically preferred. Online evaluation is effective, but inefficient for a number of reasons. Offline evaluation is much more efficient, but current methodologies often fail to accurately predict online performance. In this work, we identify three ways to improve and extend current work on offline evaluation methodologies. More specifically, we believe there is much room for improvement in temporal evaluation, off-policy evaluation, and moving beyond using just clicks to evaluate performance.},

Pairwise learning-to-rank techniques have been relatively successful. Hence, they are popularly used for learning recommender model parameters such as those in collaborative filtering (CF) models. The model parameters are learned by optimizing close smooth approximations of the non-smooth information retrieval (IR) metrics such as Mean Area Under ROC curve (AUC).Targeted campaigns are an alternative to item recommendations for increasing conversion. The user ranking task is referred to as audience retrieval. It is used in targeted campaigns to rank push campaign recipients based on their potential to convert. In this work, we consider the task of efficiently learning a ranking model that provides item recommendations and user rankings simultaneously. We adopt pairwise learning for this task. We refer to our approach as multi-objective pairwise ranking (MPR).We describe our approach and use experiments to evaluate its performance.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning for recommendation (RL4Rec) methods are increasingly receiving attention as an effective way to improve long-term user engagement. However, applying RL4Rec online comes with risks: exploration may lead to periods of detrimental user experience. Moreover, few researchers have access to real-world recommender systems. Simulations have been put forward as a solution where user feedback is simulated based on logged historical user data, thus enabling optimization and evaluation without being run online. While simulators do not risk the user experience and are widely accessible, we identify an important limitation of existing simulation methods. They ignore the interaction biases present in logged user data, and consequently, these biases affect the resulting simulation. As a solution to this issue, we introduce a debiasing step in the simulation pipeline, which corrects for the biases present in the logged data before it is used to simulate user behavior. To evaluate the effects of bias on RL4Rec simulations, we propose a novel evaluation approach for simulators that considers the performance of policies optimized with the simulator. Our results reveal that the biases from logged data negatively impact the resulting policies, unless corrected for with our debiasing method. While our debiasing methods can be applied to any simulator, we make our complete pipeline publicly available as the Simulator for OFfline leArning and evaluation (SOFA): the first simulator that accounts for interaction biases prior to optimization and evaluation.},

abstract = {Recent work suggests that music recommender systems are prone to disproportionally frequent recommendations of music from countries more prominently represented in the training data, notably the US. However, it remains unclear to what extent feedback loops in music recommendation influence the dynamics of such imbalance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of representation of local (i.e., country-specific) and US-produced music in user profiles and recommendations. To this end, we conduct a feedback loop simulation study using the LFM-2b dataset. The results suggest that most of the investigated recommendation models decrease the proportion of music from local artists in their recommendations. Furthermore, we find that models preserving average proportions of US and local music do not necessarily provide country-calibrated recommendations. We also look into popularity calibration and, surprisingly, find that the most popularity-calibrated model in our study (ItemKNN) provides the least country-calibrated recommendations. In addition, users from less represented countries (e.g., Finland) are, in the long term, most affected by the under-representation of their local music in recommendations.},

abstract = {The workshop features presentations of accepted contributions to the RecSys Challenge 2021, organized by Politecnico di Bari, ETH Z\"{u}rich, J\"{o}nk\"{o}ping University, and the data set is provided by Twitter. The challenge focuses on a real-world task of tweet engagement prediction in a dynamic environment. For 2021, the challenge considers four different engagement types: Likes, Retweet, Quote, and replies. This year’s challenge brings the problem even closer to Twitter’s real recommender systems by introducing latency constraints. We also increases the data size to encourage novel methods. Also, the data density is increased in terms of the graph where users are considered to be nodes and interactions as edges. The goal is twofold: to predict the probability of different engagement types of a target user for a set of Tweets based on heterogeneous input data while providing fair recommendations. In fact, multi-goal optimization considering accuracy and fairness is particularly challenging. However, we believed that the recommendation community was nowadays mature enough to face the challenge of providing accurate and, at the same time, fair recommendations. To this end, Twitter has released a public dataset of close to 1 billion data points, &gt; 40 million each day over 28 days. Week 1 − 3 will be used for training and week 4 for evaluation and testing. Each datapoint contains the tweet along with engagement features, user features, and tweet features. A peculiarity of this challenge is related to keeping the dataset updated with the platform: if a user deletes a Tweet, or their data from Twitter, the dataset is promptly updated. Moreover, each change in the dataset implied new evaluations of all submissions and the update of the leaderboard metrics. The challenge was well received with 578 registered users, and 386 submissions.},

abstract = {Multi-objective recommender systems (MORS) aim to optimize multiple criteria while generating recommendations, such as relevance, novelty, diversity, or exploration. These algorithms are based on the assumption that an operationalization of these criteria (i.e., translating abstract goals into measurable metrics), will reflect how users perceive them. Nevertheless, such beliefs are rarely rigorously evaluated, which can lead to a mismatch between algorithmic goals and user satisfaction. Moreover, if users are allowed to control the RS via their propensities towards such objectives, the misconceptions may further impact users’ trust and engagement. To characterize this problem, we conduct a large user study focusing on recommender systems in two domains: books and movies. Part of the study is focused on how users perceive different recommendation objectives, which we compared with well-established metrics aiming at the same objectives. We found that despite such metrics correlating to some extent with users’ perceptions, the mapping is far from perfect. Moreover, we also report on conceptual-level differences in users’ understanding of RS objectives and how this affects the results. Study data are available from .},

abstract = {The main source of knowledge utilized in recommender systems (RS) is users’ feedback. While the usage of implicit feedback (i.e. user’s behavior statistics) is gaining in prominence, the explicit feedback (i.e. user’s ratings) remain an important data source. This is true especially for domains, where evaluation of an object does not require an extensive usage and users are well motivated to do so (e.g., video-on-demand services or library archives). So far, numerous rating schemes for explicit feedback have been proposed, ranging both in granularity and presentation style. There are several works studying the effect of rating’s scale and presentation on user’s rating behavior, e.g. willingness to provide feedback or various biases in rating behavior. Nonetheless, the effect of ratings granularity on RS performance remain largely under-researched. In this paper, we studied the combined effect of ratings granularity and supposed probability of feedback existence on various performance statistics of recommender systems. Results indicate that decreasing feedback granularity may lead to changes in RS’s performance w.r.t. nDCG for some recommending algorithms. Nonetheless, in most cases the effect of feedback granularity is surpassed by even a small decrease in feedback’s quantity. Therefore, our results corroborate the policy of many major real-world applications, i.e. preference of simpler rating schemes with the higher chance of feedback reception instead of finer-grained rating scenarios.},

abstract = {Slate generation is a common task in streaming and e-commerce platforms, where multiple items are presented together as a list or “slate”. Traditional systems focus mostly on item-level ranking and often fail to capture the coherence of the slate as a whole. A key challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of selecting multiple items jointly. To manage this, conventional approaches often assume users interact with only one item at a time, assumption that breaks down when items are meant to be consumed together.In this paper, we introduce DMSG, a generative framework based on diffusion models for prompt-conditioned slate generation. DMSG learns high-dimensional structural patterns and generates coherent, diverse slates directly from natural language prompts. Unlike retrieval-based or autoregressive models, DMSG models the joint distribution over slates, enabling greater flexibility and diversity.We evaluate DMSG in two key domains: music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle creation. In both cases, DMSG produces high-quality slates from textual prompts without explicit personalization signals. Offline and online results show that DMSG outperforms strong baselines in both relevance and diversity, offering a scalable, low-latency solution for prompt-driven recommendation. A live A/B test on a production playlist system further demonstrates increased user engagement and content diversity.},

abstract = {Recommender systems research seldom considers children as a user group, and when it does, it is anchored on datasets where children are underrepresented, risking overlooking their interests, favoring those of the majority, i.e., mainstream users. Recently, Ungruh et al. demonstrated that children’s consumption patterns and preferences differ from those of mainstream users, resulting in inconsistent recommendation algorithm performance and behavior for this user group. These findings, however, are based on two datasets with a limited child user sample. We reproduce and replicate this study on a wider range of datasets in the movie, music, and book domains, uncovering interaction patterns and aspects of child-recommender interactions consistent across domains, as well as those specific to some user samples in the data. We also extend insights from the original study with popularity bias metrics, given the interpretation of results from the original study. With this reproduction and extension, we uncover consumption patterns and differences between age groups stemming from intrinsic differences between children and others, and those unique to specific datasets or domains.},

abstract = {Music streaming services have become one of the main sources of music consumption in the last decade, with recommender systems playing a crucial role. Since these systems partially determine which songs listeners hear, they significantly influence the artists behind the music. However, when assessing the performance and fairness of music recommender systems, the perspectives of artists and others working in the music industry are often overlooked. Additionally, artists express a desire for greater transparency regarding why certain songs are recommended while others are not. This research project adopts a multi-stakeholder approach to close the gap between music recommender systems and the artists whose music they recommend. First, we gather insights from artists and music industry professionals through interviews and questionnaires. Building on those insights, we then aim to improve matching between end users and music from lesser-known artists by generating rich item and user representations. Results will be evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Lastly, we plan to effectively communicate music recommender system fairness by increasing transparency for both end users and artists.},

Given session data consisting of views and purchases, as well as content data representing the fashion characteristics of the items, the task was to predict which item was purchased at the end of the session. The challenge ran for 3 months with a public leaderboard and final result on a separate hidden test set. There were over 300 teams that submitted a solution to the leaderboard and about 50 that submitted a solution for the final test set. The winning team achieved a MRR score of 0.216 which means that the correct target item was on average ranked 5th in the list of predictions. We identify some interesting common themes among the solutions in this paper and the winning approaches are presented in the workshop.},

abstract = {In very sparse recommender data sets, attributes of users such as age, gender and home location and attributes of items such as, in the case of movies, genre, release year, and director can improve the recommendation accuracy, especially for users and items that have few ratings. While most recommendation models can be extended to take attributes of users and items into account, their architectures usually become more complicated. While attributes for items are often easy to be provided, attributes for users are often scarce for reasons of privacy or simply because they are not relevant to the operational process at hand. In this paper, we address these two problems for attribute-aware recommender systems by proposing a simple model that co-embeds users and items into a joint latent space in a similar way as a vanilla matrix factorization, but with non-linear latent features construction that seamlessly can ingest user or item attributes or both (GraphRec). To address the second problem, scarce attributes, the proposed model treats the user-item relation as a bipartite graph and constructs generic user and item attributes via the Laplacian of the user-item co-occurrence graph that requires no further external side information but the mere rating matrix. In experiments on three recommender datasets, we show that GraphRec significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art attribute-aware and content-aware recommender systems even without using any side information.},

abstract = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to alleviate the data sparsity issue in recommendation systems and has garnered substantial research interest. In recent years, dual-target CDR has been an increasingly prevalent research topic that emphasizes simultaneous enhancement in both the source and target domains. Many existing approaches rely on overlapping users as bridges between domains, yet in real-world scenarios, the number of such users is often severely limited, restricting their practical applicability. To overcome this limitation, alternative methods for cross-domain connections are needed, and item tags serve as a promising solution. However, real-world tags suffer from severe deficiencies in terms of both quantity and diversity, and existing studies have not fully exploited their potential. In this paper, we introduce Tag-Augmented Dual-Target Cross Domain Recommendation (TA-DTCDR), which is the first to apply LLM-distilled tag information to CDR. TA-DTCDR utilizes item tags distilled by large language models (LLMs) as an additional channel to facilitate information transfer, thereby mitigating performance decline caused by the lack of overlapping users. Furthermore, to fully leverage the natural language information carried by the distilled tags, we design a series of training tasks to align tag semantics across domains while preserving their semantic independence. The proposed method is validated on multiple tasks using public datasets, showing significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Industrial recommendation platforms are increasingly concerned with how to make recommendations that cause users to enjoy their long term experience on the platform. Reinforcement learning emerged naturally as an appealing approach for its promise in 1) combating feedback loop effect resulted from myopic system behaviors; and 2) sequential planning to optimize long term outcome. Scaling RL algorithms to production recommender systems serving billions of users and contents, however remain challenging. Sample inefficiency and instability of online RL hinder its widespread adoption in production. Offline RL enables usage of off-policy data and batch learning. It on the other hand faces significant challenges in learning due to the distribution shift. A REINFORCE agent&nbsp;[3] was successfully tested for YouTube recommendation, significantly outperforming a sophisticated supervised learning production system. Off-policy correction was employed to learn from logged data. The algorithm partially mitigates the distribution shift by employing a one-step importance weighting. We resort to the off-policy actor critic algorithms to addresses the distribution shift to a better extent. Here we share the key designs in setting up an off-policy actor-critic agent for production recommender systems. It extends &nbsp;[3] with a critic network that estimates the value of any state-action pairs under the target learned policy through temporal difference learning. We demonstrate in offline and live experiments that the new framework out-performs baseline and improves long term user experience. An interesting discovery along our investigation is that recommendation agents that employ a softmax policy parameterization, can end up being too pessimistic about out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Finding the right balance between pessimism and optimism on OOD actions is critical to the success of offline RL for recommender systems.},

Key challenges in this field include modeling user preferences based on implicit behaviors, accounting for the influence of the news agenda on user interests, and managing the rapid decay of news items. The ACM RecSys Challenge 2024, organized by Ekstra Bladet, provide a large-scale news dataset for benchmarking news recommendation research. In this paper, we present our solution to the challenge. We propose real-time feedback learning mechanisms to capture users’ immediate interests and explore generative sequence modeling techniques to learn impression-level user behaviors. Furthermore, we develop an ensemble method to combine tree models and deep models to improve recommendation accuracy. Based on this solution, our team ("hrec") achieved an impressive AUC score of 0.8667 on the final test set, securing the fifth place in the competition.},

abstract = {Recent work in recommender systems has emphasized the importance of fairness, with a particular interest in bias and transparency, in addition to predictive accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the state of the art pairwise ranking model, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which has previously been found to outperform pointwise models in predictive accuracy, while also being able to handle implicit feedback. Specifically, we address two limitations of BPR: (1) BPR is a black box model that does not explain its outputs, thus limiting the user’s trust in the recommendations, and the analyst’s ability to scrutinize a model’s outputs; and (2) BPR is vulnerable to exposure bias due to the data being Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This exposure bias usually translates into an unfairness against the least popular items because they risk being under-exposed by the recommender system. In this work, we first propose a novel explainable loss function and a corresponding Matrix Factorization-based model called Explainable Bayesian Personalized Ranking (EBPR) that generates recommendations along with item-based explanations. Then, we theoretically quantify additional exposure bias resulting from the explainability, and use it as a basis to propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal EBPR loss. The result is a ranking model that aptly captures both debiased and explainable user preferences. Finally, we perform an empirical study on three real-world datasets that demonstrate the advantages of our proposed models.},

abstract = {While sequential recommender systems achieve significant improvements on capturing user dynamics, we argue that sequential recommenders are vulnerable against substitution-based profile pollution attacks. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we propose a substitution-based adversarial attack algorithm, which modifies the input sequence by selecting certain vulnerable elements and substituting them with adversarial items. In both untargeted and targeted attack scenarios, we observe significant performance deterioration using the proposed profile pollution algorithm. Motivated by such observations, we design an efficient adversarial defense method called Dirichlet neighborhood sampling. Specifically, we sample item embeddings from a convex hull constructed by multi-hop neighbors to replace the original items in input sequences. During sampling, a Dirichlet distribution is used to approximate the probability distribution in the neighborhood such that the recommender learns to combat local perturbations. Additionally, we design an adversarial training method tailored for sequential recommender systems. In particular, we represent selected items with one-hot encodings and perform gradient ascent on the encodings to search for the worst case linear combination of item embeddings in training. As such, the embedding function learns robust item representations and the trained recommender is resistant to test-time adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of both our attack and defense methods, which consistently outperform baselines by a significant margin across model architectures and datasets.},

abstract = {Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently released videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user’s attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users’ attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users' preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social networks can also provide useful information to understand users' preference as suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently, deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information. However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models treat neighbors' information equally without considering the specific recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models do not explicitly capture the neighbor's opinions to items for social recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are more and more often modelled as repeated decision making processes – deciding which (ranking of) items to recommend to a given user. Each decision to recommend or rank an item has a significant impact on immediate and future user responses, long-term satisfaction or engagement with the system, and possibly valuable exposure for the item provider. This interactive and interventionist view of the recommender uncovers a plethora of unanswered research questions, as it complicates the typically adopted offline evaluation or learning procedures in the field. We need an understanding of causal inference to reason about (possibly unintended) consequences of the recommender, and a notion of counterfactuals to answer common “what if”-type questions in learning and evaluation. Advances at the intersection of these fields can foster progress in effective, efficient and fair learning and evaluation from logged data. These topics have been emerging in the Recommender Systems community for a while, but we firmly believe in the value of a dedicated forum and place to learn and exchange ideas. We welcome contributions from both academia and industry and bring together a growing community of researchers and practitioners interested in sequential decision making, offline evaluation, batch policy learning, fairness in online platforms, as well as other related tasks, such as A/B testing.},

abstract = {In modern online platforms, incentives (e.g., discounts, bonus) are essential factors that enhance user engagement and increase platform revenue. Over recent years, uplift modeling has been introduced as a strategic approach to assign incentives to individual customers. Especially in many real-world applications, online platforms can only incentivize customers with specific budget constraints. This problem can be reformulated as the multi-choice knapsack problem (MCKP). The objective of this optimization is to select the optimal incentive for each customer to maximize the return on investment (ROI). Recent works in this field frequently tackle the budget allocation problem using a two-stage approach. However, this solution is confronted with the following challenges: (1) The causal inference methods often ignore the domain knowledge in online marketing, where the expected response curve of a customer should be monotonic and smooth as the incentive increases. (2) There is an optimality gap between the two stages, resulting in inferior sub-optimal allocation performance due to the loss of the incentive recommendation information for the uplift prediction under the limited budget constraint. To address these challenges, we propose a novel End-to-End Cost-Effective Incentive Recommendation (E3IR) model under the budget constraint. Specifically, our methods consist of two modules, i.e., the uplift prediction module and the differentiable allocation module. In the uplift prediction module, we construct prediction heads to capture the incremental improvement between adjacent treatments with the marketing domain constraints (i.e., monotonic and smooth). We incorporate integer linear programming (ILP) as a differentiable layer input in the differentiable allocation module. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on public and real product datasets, demonstrating that our E3IR improves allocation performance compared to existing two-stage approaches.},

Whilst the prediction module is purely based on an implicit low-rank assumption imposed via nuclear norm regularization, our loss function is augmented by an uncertainty estimation module which learns an anomaly score for each individual rating via a Graph Neural Network: data points deemed more anomalous by the GNN are downregulated in the loss function used to train the low-rank module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the anomaly detection module to tap on the supervised information available in the form of ratings. Thus, our model’s predictors enjoy the favourable generalization properties that come with being chosen from small function space (i.e., low-rank matrices), whilst exhibiting the robustness to outliers and flexibility that comes with deep learning methods. Furthermore, the anomaly scores themselves contain valuable qualitative information. Experiments on various real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms standard matrix completion and other baselines, confirming the usefulness of the anomaly detection module.},

abstract = {Collaborative prediction involves filling in missing entries of a user-item matrix to predict preferences of users based on their observed preferences. Most of existing models assume that the data is missing at random (MAR), which is often violated in recommender systems in practice. Incorrect assumption on missing data ignores the missing data mechanism, leading to biased inferences and prediction. In this paper we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction, where the generative process for data and missing data mechanism are jointly modeled to handle non-random missing data. Missing data mechanism is modeled by three factors, each of which is related to users, items, and rating values. Each factor is modeled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating value is determined by the Boolean OR operation of three binary variables. We develop computationally-efficient variational inference algorithms, where variational parameters have closed-form update rules and the computational complexity depends on the number of observed ratings, instead of the size of the rating data matrix. We also discuss implementation issues on hyperparameter tuning and estimation based on empirical Bayes. Experiments on Yahoo! Music and MovieLens datasets confirm the useful behavior of our model by demonstrating that: (1) it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in yielding higher predictive performance; (2) it finds meaningful solutions instead of undesirable boundary solutions; (3) it provides rating trend analysis on why ratings are observed.},

abstract = {The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric. With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance. These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation). Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios. The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates. Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it. This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements. Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings.},

abstract = {In the real world, when we seek our friends’ opinions on various items or events, we request verbal social recommendations. It has been observed that we often turn to our friends for recommendations on a daily basis. The emergence of online social platforms has enabled users to share their opinion with their social connections. Therefore, we should consider users’ social connections to enhance online recommendation performance. The social recommendation aims to fuse social links with user-item interactions to offer more relevant recommendations. Several efforts have been made to develop an effective social recommendation system. However, there are two significant limitations to current methods: First, they haven’t thoroughly explored the intricate relationships between the diverse influences of neighbours on users’ preferences. Second, existing models are vulnerable to overfitting due to the relatively low number of user-item interaction records in the interaction space. For the aforementioned problems, this paper offers a novel framework called CR-SoRec, an effective recommendation model based on BERT and consistency regularization. This model incorporates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer(BERT) to learn bidirectional context-aware user and item embeddings with neighbourhood sampling. The neighbourhood Sampling technique samples the most influential neighbours for all the users/ items. Further, to effectively use the available user-item interaction data and social ties, we leverage diverse perspectives via consistency regularization to harness the underlying information. The main objective of our model is to predict the next item that a user would interact with based on its interaction behaviour and social connections. Experimental results show that our model defines a new state-of-the-art on various datasets and outperforms previous work by a significant margin. Extensive experiments are also conducted to analyze the proposed method.},

abstract = {Modeling the complex interactions between users and items as well as amongst items themselves is at the core of designing successful recommender systems. One classical setting is predicting users' personalized sequential behavior (or 'next-item' recommendation), where the challenges mainly lie in modeling 'third-order' interactions between a user, her previously visited item(s), and the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these higher-order interactions into a combination of pairwise relationships, by way of which user preferences (user-item interactions) and sequential patterns (item-item interactions) are captured by separate components. In this paper, we propose a unified method, TransRec, to model such third-order relationships for large-scale sequential prediction. Methodologically, we embed items into a 'transition space' where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. Empirically, this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a wide spectrum of real-world datasets. Data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/ruining-he/.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are an important component in the retail industry, but the constantly renewed inventory of many companies makes it difficult to aggregate enough data to fully harness the benefits of such systems. In this paper, we describe a technique that significantly improves the accuracy of the recommendations, validated on a real store transaction history, by performing a time translation that maps out-of-stock items to similar items that are currently in stock using deep features of the products. This greatly reduces the dimension of the item-item interactions matrix while preserving all the dataset entries, which mitigates the sparsity of the dataset, and provides an original solution to the cold-start problem. We also improve the coverage at no accuracy cost by favouring less popular items within a small radius in the feature space while applying the time translation mapping. Finally, by modelling item-item rather that user-item correlations, we are able to update the recommendations for a given user in real-time, without re-training, as the user's history receives new entries.},

abstract = {Privacy protection in recommendation systems is gaining increasing attention, for which federated learning has emerged as a promising solution. Current federated recommendation systems grapple with high communication overhead due to sharing dense global embeddings, and also poorly reflect user preferences due to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage Federated Low-rank Coordinated Adaptation (FedLoCA) framework to decouple global and client-specific knowledge into low-rank embeddings, which significantly reduces communication overhead while enhancing the system’s ability to capture individual user preferences amidst data heterogeneity. Further, to tackle gradient estimation inaccuracies stemming from data sparsity in federated recommendation systems, we introduce an adversarial gradient projected descent approach in low-rank spaces, which significantly boosts model performance while maintaining robustness. Remarkably, FedLoCA also alleviates performance loss even under the stringent constraints of differential privacy. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that FedLoCA significantly outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and communication efficiency.},

However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM’s outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM’s separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.},

Therefore, it is imperative that offline evaluation setups are as realistic and as flawless as they can be. Unfortunately, evaluation flaws are quite common in recommender systems research nowadays, due to later works copying flawed evaluation setups from their predecessors without questioning their validity. In the hope of improving the quality of offline evaluation of recommender systems, we discuss four of these widespread flaws and why researchers should avoid them.},

In this paper, we leverage post-click feedback, e.g. skips and completions, to improve the training and evaluation of content recommenders. Specifically, we experiment with existing collaborative filtering algorithms and find that they perform poorly against post-click-aware ranking metrics. Based on these insights, we develop a generic probabilistic framework to fuse click and post-click signals. We show how our framework can be applied to improve pointwise and pairwise recommendation models.

The objective of this tutorial is to offer a comprehensive review of recent advances to represent, transform and incorporate the different modalities into recommendation models.

abstract = {Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is available. For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item, and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks. We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in recommendation, even when the target user's review for the target item is not available. Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item pair. We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another latent representation of the target user's review of the target item. We show that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Scalability issue plays a crucial role in productionizing modern recommender systems. Even lightweight architectures may suffer from high computational overload due to intermediate calculations, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. Specifically, applying full Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendations quality. Still, it suffers from excessive GPU memory utilization when dealing with large item catalogs. This paper introduces a novel Scalable Cross-Entropy (SCE) loss function in the sequential learning setup. It approximates the CE loss for datasets with large-size catalogs, enhancing both time efficiency and memory usage without compromising recommendations quality. Unlike traditional negative sampling methods, our approach utilizes a selective GPU-efficient computation strategy, focusing on the most informative elements of the catalog, particularly those most likely to be false positives. This is achieved by approximating the softmax distribution over a subset of the model outputs through the maximum inner product search. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCE in reducing peak memory usage by a factor of up to 100 compared to the alternatives, retaining or even exceeding their metrics values. The proposed approach also opens new perspectives for large-scale developments in different domains, such as large language models.},

abstract = {Podcasting is an increasingly popular medium for entertainment and discourse around the world, with tens of thousands of new podcasts released on a monthly basis. We consider the problem of identifying from these newly-released podcasts those with the largest potential audiences so they can be considered for personalized recommendation to users. We first study and then discard a supervised approach due to the inadequacy of either content or consumption features for this task, and instead propose a novel non-contextual bandit algorithm in the fixed-budget infinitely-armed pure-exploration setting. We demonstrate that our algorithm is well-suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study, and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches.},

abstract = {Recommender system plays a vital role in various online services. However, its insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific closed domain limits its access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders cannot meet the inference latency demand of industrial recommender systems. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs — the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. We deploy KAR to Huawei’s news and music recommendation platforms and gain a 7% and 1.7% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.},

abstract = {Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behavior aimed at the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries), and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that takes into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 48% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.},

abstract = {Classical recommender system methods typically face the filter bubble problem when users only receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To address the filter bubble problem, unexpected recommendations have been proposed to recommend items significantly deviating from user’s prior expectations and thus surprising them by presenting ”fresh” and previously unexplored items to the users. In this paper, we describe a novel Personalized Unexpected Recommender System (PURS) model that incorporates unexpectedness into the recommendation process by providing multi-cluster modeling of user interests in the latent space and personalized unexpectedness via the self-attention mechanism and via selection of an appropriate unexpected activation function. Extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate that the proposed PURS model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy and unexpectedness measures. In addition, we conduct an online A/B test at a major video platform Alibaba-Youku, where our model achieves over 3% increase in the average video view per user metric. The proposed model is in the process of being deployed by the company.},

abstract = {Frequent updates and model retraining are important in various application areas of recommender systems, e.g., news recommendation. Moreover, in such domains, we may not only face the problem of dealing with a constant stream of new data, but also with anonymous users, leading to the problem of streaming session-based recommendation (SSR). Such problem settings have attracted increased interest in recent years, and different deep learning architectures were proposed that support fast updates of the underlying prediction models when new data arrive. In a recent paper, a method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) was proposed as being superior than previous methods for the SSR problem. The baselines in the reported experiments included different machine learning models. However, several earlier studies have shown that often conceptually simpler methods, e.g., based on nearest neighbors, can be highly effective for session-based recommendation problems. In this work, we report a similar phenomenon for the streaming configuration. We first reproduce the results of the mentioned GNN method and then show that simpler methods are able to outperform this complex state-of-the-art neural method on two datasets. Overall, our work points to continued methodological issues in the academic community, e.g., in terms of the choice of baselines and reproducibility.1},

The challenge focuses on a real-world task of Tweet engagement prediction in a dynamic environment. The goal is to predict the probability for different types of engagement (Like, Reply, Retweet, and Retweet with comment) of a target user for a set of Tweets, based on heterogeneous input data. To this end, Twitter has released a large public dataset of ~160M public Tweets, obtained by subsampling within ~2 weeks, that contains engagement features, user features, and Tweet features. A peculiarity of this challenge is related to the recent regulations on data protection and privacy. The challenge data set was compliant: if a user deleted a Tweet, or their data from Twitter, the dataset was promptly updated. Moreover, each change in the dataset implied new evaluations of all submissions and the update of the leaderboard metrics. The challenge was well received with 1,131 registered users. In the final phase, 20 teams were competing for the winning position. These teams had an average size of approximately 4 participants and developed an overall number of 127 different methods.},

Motivated by the success of this approach, we introduce two different models of reviews and study their effect on collaborative filtering performance. While the previous state-of-the-art approach is based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of reviews, the models we explore are neural network based: a bag-of-words product-of-experts model and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the increased flexibility offered by the product-of-experts model allowed it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon review dataset, outperforming the LDA-based approach. However, interestingly, the greater modeling power offered by the recurrent neural network appears to undermine the model's ability to act as a regularizer of the product representations.},

abstract = {Live-streaming platforms broadcast user-generated video in real-time. Recommendation on these platforms shares similarities with traditional settings, such as a large volume of heterogeneous content and highly skewed interaction distributions. However, several challenges must be overcome to adapt recommendation algorithms to live-streaming platforms: first, content availability is dynamic which restricts users to choose from only a subset of items at any given time; during training and inference we must carefully handle this factor in order to properly account for such signals, where ‘non-interactions’ reflect availability as much as implicit preference. Streamers are also fundamentally different from ‘items’ in traditional settings: repeat consumption of specific channels plays a significant role, though the content itself is fundamentally ephemeral. In this work, we study recommendation in this setting of a dynamically evolving set of available items. We propose LiveRec, a self-attentive model that personalizes item ranking based on both historical interactions and current availability. We also show that carefully modelling repeat consumption plays a significant role in model performance. To validate our approach, and to inspire further research on this setting, we release a dataset containing 475M user interactions on Twitch over a 43-day period. We evaluate our approach on a recommendation task and show our method to outperform various strong baselines in ranking the currently available content.},

The properties of the predictor are empirically studied by checking the correlation of the predictor output with a performance measure.

abstract = {Nowadays we commonly have multiple sources of data associated with items. Users may provide numerical ratings, or implicit interactions, but may also provide textual reviews. Although many algorithms have been proposed to jointly learn a model over both interactions and textual data, there is room to improve the many factorization models that are proven to work well on interactions data, but are not designed to exploit textual information. Our focus in this work is to propose a simple, yet easily applicable and effective, method to incorporate review data into such factorization models. In particular, we propose to build the user and item embeddings within the topic space of a topic model learned from the review data. This has several advantages: we observe that initializing the user and item embeddings in topic space leads to faster convergence of the factorization algorithm to a model that out-performs models initialized randomly, or with other state-of-the-art initialization strategies. Moreover, constraining user and item factors to topic space allows for the learning of an interpretable model that users can visualise.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a strategy to provide users with explainable cross-domain recommendations (CDR) that exploits large language models (LLMs). Generally speaking, CDR is a task that is hard to tackle, mainly due to data sparsity issues. Indeed, CDR models require a large amount of data labeled in both source and target domains, which are not easy to collect. Accordingly, our approach relies on the intuition that the knowledge that is already encoded in LLMs can be used to more easily bridge the domains and seamlessly provide users with personalized cross-domain suggestions. To this end, we designed a pipeline to: (a) instruct a LLM to handle a CDR task; (b) design a personalized prompt, based on the preferences of the user in a source domain, and a list of items to be ranked in target domain; (c) feed the LLM with the prompt, in both zero-shot and one-shot settings, and process the answer in order to extract the recommendations and a natural language explanation. As shown in the experimental evaluation, our approach beats several established state-of-the-art baselines for CDR in most of the experimental settings, thus showing the effectiveness of LLMs also in this novel and scarcely investigated scenario.},

abstract = {One of the strong points of E-commerce websites is that they are often abundant with product reviews from consumers who experienced the products and testify to the usefulness of the products or otherwise. These reviews are helpful for consumers to optimize their purchasing decisions. However, while popular products receive many reviews, many other products do not have an adequate number of reviews leading to the cold item problem. In this proposal, we propose a solution outline for the cold item problem by automatically generating reviews and predicting ratings for the cold products from available reviews of similar products in e-commerce websites as well as users' opinion shared in the microblogging platforms such as Twitter. We propose a framework to build a formal semantic representation of products from unstructured product descriptions, user reviews as well as user ratings. Such presentations assist us to measure product similarity and relatedness in a accurate and cost-effective way. Besides, we propose a model to generate additional reviews for a cold product by mining users' posts shared on medium such as Twitter and transfer them to the e-commerce website. Preliminary experiments show promising results in finding products similar to the cold products.},

Observational data from historical interaction logs abound in these settings. However, since virtually all observational data exhibit biases, such as time-in-inventory or interface biases, it is crucial that recommender algorithms account for these biases. In this paper, we develop a principled approach for item-to-item recommendation based on causal inference and present a practical and highly effective method for estimating the causal parameters from a small annotated dataset.

While increasing research is dedicated to improving the relevance and diversity of the recommendations, the potential risks of state-of-the-art recommendation models are under-explored, that is, these models could be subject to attacks from malicious third parties, through injecting fake user interactions to achieve their purposes. This paper revisits the adversarially-learned injection attack problem, where the injected fake user ‘behaviors’ are learned locally by the attackers with their own model – one that is potentially different from the model under attack, but shares similar properties to allow attack transfer. We found that most existing works in literature suffer from two major limitations: (1) they do not solve the optimization problem precisely, making the attack less harmful than it could be, (2) they assume perfect knowledge for the attack, causing the lack of understanding for realistic attack capabilities. We demonstrate that the exact solution for generating fake users as an optimization problem could lead to a much larger impact. Our experiments on a real-world dataset reveal important properties of the attack, including attack transferability and its limitations. These findings can inspire useful defensive methods against this possible existing attack.},

Inferring the causal impact of new track releases is critical to fully characterizing the interplay between artists and listeners, as well as among the artists. In this study, we infer and quantify causality using a diffusion-regression state-space model that constructs counterfactual outcomes using a set of synthetic controls, which predict potential outcomes in absence of the intervention. Based on large scale experiments spanning over 21 million users and 1 billion streams on a real world streaming platform, our findings suggest that releasing a new track has a positive impact on the popularity of other tracks by the same artist. Interestingly, other related and competing artists also benefit from a new track release, which hints at the presence of a positive platform-effect wherein some artists gain significantly from activities of other artists.},

abstract = {Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation(CDSR) aims to generate accurate predictions for future interactions by leveraging users’ cross-domain historical interactions. One major challenge of CDSR is how to jointly learn the single- and cross-domain user preferences efficiently. To enhance the target domain’s performance, most existing solutions start by learning the single-domain user preferences within each domain and then transferring the acquired knowledge from the rich domain to the target domain. However, this approach ignores the inter-sequence item relationship and also limits the opportunities for target domain knowledge to enhance the rich domain performance. Moreover, it also ignores the information within the cross-domain sequence. Despite cross-domain sequences being generally noisy and hard to learn directly, they contain valuable user behavior patterns with great potential to enhance performance. Another key challenge of CDSR is data sparsity, which also exists in other recommendation system problems. In the real world, the data distribution of the recommendation system is highly skewed to the popular products, especially on the large-scale dataset with millions of users and items. One more challenge is the class imbalance problem, inherited by the sequential recommendation problem. Generally, each sample only has one positive and thousands of negative samples. To address the above problems together, an innovative Decoupled Representation via Extraction Attention Module (DREAM) is proposed for CDSR to simultaneously learn single- and cross-domain user preference via decoupled representations. A novel Supervised Contrastive Learning framework is introduced to model the inter-sequence relationship as well as address the data sparsity via data augmentations. DREAM also leverages Focal Loss to put more weight on misclassified samples to address the class-imbalance problem, with another uplift on the overall model performance. Extensive experiments had been conducted on two cross-domain recommendation datasets, demonstrating DREAM outperforms various SOTA cross-domain recommendation algorithms achieving up to a 75% uplift in Movie-Book Scenarios.},

abstract = {The purpose of recommenders is often summarized as "help the users find relevant items", and the predominant operationalization of this goal has been to focus on the ability to numerically estimate the users' preferences for unseen items or to provide users with item lists ranked in accordance to the estimated preferences. This dominant, albeit narrow, view of the recommendation problem has been tremendously helpful in advancing research in different ways, e.g., through the establishment of standardized evaluation procedures and metrics. In reality, recommender systems can serve a variety of purposes from the point of view of both consumers and providers. Most of the purposes, however, are significantly underexplored, even though many of them are arguably more aligned with the real-world expectations for recommenders than our current predominant paradigm. Therefore, it is important to revisit our conceptualizations of the potential goals of recommenders and their operationalization as research problems. In this paper, we discuss a framework of recommendation goals and purposes and highlight possible future directions and challenges related to the operationalization of such alternative problem formulations.},

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by qualitative impairments in social relatedness and interaction, as well as difficulties in acquiring and using communication and language abilities. Adults with ASD often find it difficult to express and recognize emotions which makes it hard for them to interact with others socially. We have designed new interactive and collaborative games for autistic adults and developed a novel strategy to recommend games to them. Using modern computer vision and graphics techniques, we (i) track the player's speech rate, facial features, eye contact, audio communication, and emotional states, and (ii) foster their collaboration. These games are personalized and recommended to a user based on games interested to the user, besides the complexity of games at different levels according to the deficient level of the emotional understanding and social skills to which the user belongs. The objective of developing and recommending short-head (i.e., familiar) and long-tail (i.e., unfamiliar) games for adults with ASD is to enhance their social interacting skills with peers so that they can live a better life.},

abstract = {Recommender System (RS) is an essential component of many businesses, especially in e-commerce domain. RS exploits the preference history (rating, purchase, review, etc.) of users in order to provide the recommendations. A user in traditional RS can provide only one rating value about an item. Deep Neural Networks have been used in this single rating system to improve recommendation accuracy in the recent times. However, the single rating systems are inadequate to understand the usersfi preferences about an item. On the other hand, business enterprises such as tourism, e-learning, etc. facilitate users to provide multiple criteria ratings about an item, thus it becomes easier to understand users' preference over single rating system. In this paper, we propose an extended Stacked Autoencoders (a Deep Neural Network technique) to utilize the multi-criteria ratings. The proposed network is designed to learn the relationship between each user's criteria and overall rating efficiently. Experimental results on real world datasets (Yahoo! Movies and TripAdvisor) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art single rating systems and multi-criteria approaches on various performance metrics.},

abstract = {In many commercial systems, the 'best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall).An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.},

abstract = {Traditional recommendation systems mainly focus on modeling user interests. However, the dynamics of recommended items caused by attribute modifications (e.g. changes in prices) are also of great importance in real systems, especially in the fast-growing e-commerce environment, which may cause the users’ demands to emerge, shift and disappear. Recent studies that make efforts on dynamic item representations treat the item attributes as side information but ignore its temporal dependency, or model the item evolution with a sequence of related users but do not consider item attributes. In this paper, we propose Core Attribute Evolution Network (CAEN), which partitions the user sequence according to the attribute value and thus models the item evolution over attribute dynamics with these users. Under this framework, we further devise a hierarchical attention mechanism that applies attribute-aware attention for user aggregation under each attribute, as well as personalized attention for activating similar users in assessing the matching degree between target user and item. Results from the extensive experiments over actual e-commerce datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods and achieves significant improvements on the items with rapid changes over attributes, therefore helping the item recommendation to adapt to the growth of the e-commerce platform.},

abstract = {Session-based recommendation is a problem setting where the task of a recommender system is to make suitable item suggestions based only on a few observed user interactions in an ongoing session. The lack of long-term preference information about individual users in such settings usually results in a limited level of personalization, where a small set of popular items may be recommended to many users. This repeated exposure of such a subset of the items through the recommendations may in turn lead to a reinforcement effect over time, and to a system which is not able to help users discover new content anymore to the desirable extent. In this work, we investigate such potential longitudinal effects of session-based recommendations in a simulation-based approach. Specifically, we analyze to what extent algorithms of different types may lead to concentration effects over time. Our experiments in the music domain reveal that all investigated algorithms—both neural and heuristic ones—may lead to lower item coverage and to a higher concentration on a subset of the items. Additional simulation experiments however also indicate that relatively simple re-ranking strategies, e.g., by avoiding too many repeated recommendations in the music domain, may help to deal with this problem.},

In this paper, we aim to shed light on the advantages of different ranking metrics which were previously used in Information Retrieval and are now used for assessing top-N recommenders. We propose methodologies for comparing the robustness and the discriminative power of different metrics. On the one hand, we study cut-offs and we find that deeper cut-offs offer greater robustness and discriminative power. On the other hand, we find that precision offers high robustness and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain provides the best discriminative power.},

abstract = {There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity - including those adapted from search result diversification - fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods.},

abstract = {Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users' preference and items' popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users' rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top-N recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon matrix factorization to optimize item rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to better model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an emerging model for encoding probabilities over subsets, such as shopping baskets, selected from a ground set, such as an item catalog. They have recently proved to be appealing models for a number of machine learning tasks, including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Prior work has shown that using a low-rank factorization of this kernel provides scalability improvements that open the door to training on large-scale datasets and computing online recommendations, both of which are infeasible with standard DPP models that use a full-rank kernel. A low-rank DPP model can be trained using an optimization-based method, such as stochastic gradient ascent, to find a point estimate of the kernel parameters, which can be performed efficiently on large-scale datasets. However, this approach requires careful tuning of regularization parameters to prevent overfitting and provide good predictive performance, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for learning a low-rank factorization of this kernel, which provides automatic control of regularization. We show that our Bayesian low-rank DPP model can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC). Our Bayesian model generally provides better predictive performance on several real-world product recommendation datasets than optimization-based low-rank DPP models trained using stochastic gradient ascent, and better performance than several state-of-the art recommendation methods in many cases.},

abstract = {Personalization techniques have been widely adopted in many recommender systems. However, experiments on real-world datasets show that for some users in certain contexts, personalized recommendations do not necessarily perform better than recommendations that rely purely on popularity. Broadly, this can be interpreted by the fact that the parameters of a personalization model are usually estimated from sparse data; the resulting personalized prediction, despite of its low bias, is often volatile. In this paper, we study the problem further by investigating into the ranking of recommendation lists. From a risk management and portfolio retrieval perspective, there is no difference between the popularity-based and the personalized ranking as both of the recommendation outputs can be represented as the trade-off between expected relevance (reward) and associated uncertainty (risk). Through our analysis, we discover common scenarios and provide a technique to predict whether personalization will fail. Besides the theoretical understanding, our experimental results show that the resulting switch algorithm, which decides whether or not to personalize, outperforms the mainstream recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance. We refer to our approach as 'Free Lunch' enhancement since it leverages clusters that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of 'Free Lunch' information inherent in a user-item matrix from a auxiliary domain that is different from the target domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case, in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case, in which they do not. Although 'Free Lunch' enhancement does not apply equally well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present, but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.},

In this paper, we focus on a variation of this problem in which we aim to predict repurchases, i.e. we wish to recommend a user only items she had purchased before. We coin this problem Next Basket Repurchase Recommendation (NBRR). Over the years, a variety of models have been proposed to address the problem of NBR, however, the problem of NBRR has been overlooked. Although being highly related problems, which are often solved by the same methods, the problem of repurchase recommendation calls for a different approach. In this paper, we share insights from our experience of facing the challenge of NBRR. In light of these insights, we propose a novel hyper-convolutional model to leverage the behavioral patterns of repeated purchases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on three publicly available datasets, where it is shown to outperform other existing methods across multiple metrics.},

abstract = {Achieving fairness over different user groups in recommender systems is an important problem. The majority of existing works achieve fairness through constrained optimization that combines the recommendation loss and the fairness constraint. To achieve fairness, the algorithm usually needs to know each user’s group affiliation feature such as gender or race. However, such involved user group feature is usually sensitive and requires protection. In this work, we seek a federated learning solution for the fair recommendation problem and identify the main challenge as an algorithmic conflict between the global fairness objective and the localized federated optimization process. On one hand, the fairness objective usually requires access to all users’ group information. On the other hand, the federated learning systems restrain the personal data in each user’s local space. As a resolution, we propose to communicate group statistics during federated optimization and use differential privacy techniques to avoid exposure of users’ group information when users require privacy protection. We illustrate the theoretical bounds of the noisy signal used in our method that aims to enforce privacy without overwhelming the aggregated statistics. Empirical results show that federated learning may naturally improve user group fairness and the proposed framework can effectively control this fairness with low communication overheads.},

abstract = {Negative Sampling in recommendation aims to capture informative negative instances for the sparse user-item interactions to improve the performance. Conventional negative sampling methods tend to select informative hard negative samples (HNS) besides the default random samples. However, these hard negative sampling methods usually struggle with false hard negative samples (FHNS), which happens when a user-item interaction has not been observed yet and is picked as a negative sample, while the user will actually interact with this item once exposed to it. Such FHNS issues may seriously confuse the model training, while most conventional hard negative sampling methods do not systematically explore and distinguish FHNS from HNS. To address this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic Real Hard Negative Sampling (RealHNS) framework specially for cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which aims to discover the false and refine the real from all HNS via both general and cross-domain real hard negative sample selectors. For the general part, we conduct the coarse- and fine-grained real HNS selectors sequentially, armed with a dynamic item-based FHNS filter to find high-quality HNS. For the cross-domain part, we further design a new cross-domain HNS for alleviating negative transfer in CDR and discover its corresponding FHNS via a dynamic user-based FHNS filter to keep its power. We conduct experiments on four datasets based on three representative hard negative sampling methods, along with extensive model analyses, ablation studies, and universality analyses. The consistent improvements indicate the effectiveness, robustness, and universality of RealHNS, which is also easy-to-deploy in real-world systems as a plug-and-play strategy.

In this paper we research the impact of target sampling on the outcome of comparative recommender system evaluation. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis considering the informativeness and consistency of experiments across the target size axis. We find that comparative evaluation using reduced target sets contradicts in many cases the corresponding outcome using large targets, and we provide a principled explanation for these disagreements. We further seek to determine which among the contradicting results may be more reliable. Through comparison to unbiased evaluation, we find that minimum target sets incur in substantial distortion in pairwise system comparisons, while maximum sets may not be ideal either, and better options may lie in between the extremes. We further find means for informing the target size setting in the common case where unbiased evaluation is not possible, by an assessment of the discriminative power of evaluation, that remarkably aligns with the agreement with unbiased evaluation.},

abstract = {For the past few years most published research on recommendation algorithms has been based on deep learning (DL) methods. Following common research practices in our field, these works usually demonstrate that a new DL method is outperforming other models not based on deep learning in offline experiments. This almost consistent success of DL based models is however not observed in recommendation-related machine learning competitions like the challenges that are held with the yearly ACM RecSys conference. Instead the winning solutions mostly consist of substantial feature engineering efforts and the use of gradient boosting or ensemble techniques. In this paper we investigate possible reasons for this surprising phenomenon. We consider multiple possible factors such as the characteristics and complexity of the problem settings, datasets, and DL methods; the background of the competition participants; or the particularities of the evaluation approach.},

abstract = {Throughout the years, numerous recommendation algorithms have been developed to address the information filtering problem by leveraging users’ tastes through implicit or explicit feedback. In this paper, we present the work undertaken as part of a PhD thesis focused on exploring new evaluation dimensions centred around the efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs present in state-of-the-art recommendation systems. Firstly, we highlight the lack of efficiency-oriented studies and we formulate the research problem. Then, we propose a mapping of the design space and a classification of the recommendation algorithms/models with respect to salient attributes and characteristics. At the same time, we explain why and how assessing the recommendations on an accuracy versus training cost curve would advance the current knowledge in the area of evaluation, as well as open new research avenues for exploring parameter configurations within well-known algorithms. Finally, we make the case for a comprehensive methodology that incorporates predictive efficiency-effectiveness models, which illustrate the performance and behaviour of the recommendation systems under different recommendation tasks, while satisfying user-defined quality of service constraints and goals.},

However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithmic implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations.In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.},

abstract = {Recommendation techniques have been well developed in the past decades. Most of them build models only based on user item rating matrix. However, in real world, there is plenty of auxiliary information available in recommendation systems. We can utilize these information as additional features to improve recommendation performance. We refer to recommendation with auxiliary information as context-aware recommendation. Context-aware Factorization Machines (FM) is one of the most successful context-aware recommendation models. FM models pairwise interactions between all features, in such way, a certain feature latent vector is shared to compute the factorized parameters it involved. In practice, there are tens of context features and not all the pairwise feature interactions are useful. Thus, one important challenge for context-aware recommendation is how to effectively select "good" interaction features. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem and propose a greedy interaction feature selection algorithm based on gradient boosting. Then we propose a novel Gradient Boosting Factorization Machine (GBFM) model to incorporate feature selection algorithm with Factorization Machines into a unified framework. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

In contrast, we believe that the context emerges from the activity and its change can be perceived and possibly predicted by using mined patterns of its evolution on multiple levels, starting at individual sessions.

Sales diversity is also linked with the long-tail novelty of recommendations, a quality dimension from the user perspective. We explore the inversion of the recommendation task as a means to enhance sales diversity - and indirectly novelty - by selecting which users an item should be recommended to instead of the other way around. We address the inverted task by two approaches: a) inverting the rating matrix, and b) defining a probabilistic reformulation which isolates the popularity component of arbitrary recommendation algorithms. We find that the first approach gives rise to interesting reformulations of nearest-neighbor algorithms, which essentially introduce a new neighbor selection policy. The second approach, as well as the first, ultimately result in substantial sales diversity enhancements, and improved trade-offs with recommendation precision and novelty. Two experiments on movie and music recommendation datasets show the effectiveness of the resulting approach, even when compared to direct optimization approaches of the target metrics proposed in prior work.},

abstract = {Due to the progressive advancement of trustworthy machine learning algorithms, fairness in recommender systems is attracting increasing attention and is often considered from the perspective of users. Conventional fairness-aware recommendation models assume that user preferences remain the same between the training set and the testing set. However, this assumption is arguable in reality, where user preference can shift in the testing set due to the natural spatial or temporal heterogeneity. It is concerning that conventional fairness-aware models may be unaware of such distribution shifts, leading to a sharp decline in the model performance. To address the distribution shift problem, we propose a robust fairness-aware recommendation framework based on Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) technique. In specific, we assign learnable weights for each sample to approximate the distributions that leads to the worst-case model performance, and then optimize the fairness-aware recommendation model to improve the worst-case performance in terms of both fairness and recommendation accuracy. By iteratively updating the weights and the model parameter, our framework can be robust to unseen testing sets. To ease the learning difficulty of DRO, we use a hard clustering technique to reduce the number of learnable sample weights. To optimize our framework in a full differentiable manner, we soften the above clustering strategy. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments based on four real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

abstract = {In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.},

The REVEAL workshop will focus on how to optimise this multi-step decision-making process, where a stream of interactions occurs between the user and the system. Deriving reward signals from these interactions, and creating a scalable, performant, and maintainable recommendation model to use for inference is a key challenge for machine learning teams, both in industry and academia.

Similar issues are encountered by a variety of organizations, e.g., mobile-phone manufacturers and online magazines, who have to create new (non-existent) items to satisfy groups of users with different preferences. In this paper, we present a joint problem formalization of these interrelated issues, and propose generative methods that address these questions simultaneously. Specifically, we leverage on the latent space obtained by training a deep generative model---the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)---via a loss function that incorporates both rating performance and item reconstruction terms. We use a greedy search algorithm that utilize this learned latent space to jointly obtain K plausible new items, and user groups that would find the items appealing. An evaluation of our methods on a synthetic dataset indicates that our approach is able to generate novel items similar to highly-desirable unobserved items. As case studies on real-world data, we applied our method on the MART abstract art and Movielens Tag Genome datasets, which resulted in promising results: small and diverse sets of novel items.},

Although there are many methods for content personalization and recommendation, sequential recommendation models stand out due to their ability to summarize user behavior over time. We propose a novel sequential recommendation framework to address the following key issues: suboptimal negative sampling strategies, fixed user-history context lengths, and single-task optimization objectives, insufficient engagement-aware learning, and short-sighted prediction horizons, ultimately improving both immediate and multi-step next-title prediction for video streaming services. In this work, we propose a novel approach to capture patterns of interaction at different time scales. We also align long-term user happiness with instantaneous intent signals using multi-task learning with engagement-aware personalized loss. Finally, we extend traditional next-item prediction into a next-K forecasting task using a training strategy with soft positive label. Extensive experiments on large-scale streaming data validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model outperforms the baseline in NDCG@1 by up to 3.52% under realistic ranking scenarios showing the effectiveness of our engagement-aware and MoE-enhanced designs. Results also show that soft-label Multi-K training is a practical and scalable extension, and that a balanced personalized negative sampling strategy generalizes well. Our framework outperforms baselines across all ranking metrics, providing a robust solution for production-scale streaming recommendations.},

abstract = {News is one of the earliest application domains of recommender systems, and recommending items from a virtually endless stream of news is still a relevant problem today. News recommendation is different from other application domains in a variety of ways, e.g., because new items constantly become available for recommendation. To be effective, news recommenders therefore have to continuously consider the latest items in the incoming stream of news in their recommendation models. However, today's public software libraries for algorithm benchmarking mostly do not consider these particularities of the domain. As a result, authors often rely on proprietary protocols, which hampers the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper, we present StreamingRec as a framework for evaluating streaming-based news recommenders in a replicable way. The open-source framework implements a replay-based evaluation protocol that allows algorithms to update the underlying models in real-time when new events are recorded and new articles are available for recommendation. Furthermore, a variety of baseline algorithms for session-based recommendation are part of StreamingRec. For these, we also report a number of performance results for two datasets, which confirm the importance of immediate model updates.},

abstract = {Context aware recommender systems (CARS) adapt the recommendations to the specific situation in which the items will be consumed. In this paper we present a novel context-aware recommendation algorithm that extends Matrix Factorization. We model the interaction of the contextual factors with item ratings introducing additional model parameters. The performed experiments show that the proposed solution provides comparable results to the best, state of the art, and more complex approaches. The proposed solution has the advantage of smaller computational cost and provides the possibility to represent at different granularities the interaction between context and items. We have exploited the proposed model in two recommendation applications: places of interest and music.},

abstract = {In recent times, deep learning methods have supplanted conventional collaborative filtering approaches as the backbone of modern recommender systems. However, their gains are skewed towards popular items with a drastic performance drop for the vast collection of long-tail items with sparse interactions. Moreover, we empirically show that prior neural recommenders lack the resolution power to accurately rank relevant items within the long-tail. In this paper, we formulate long-tail item recommendations as a few-shot learning problem of learning-to-recommend few-shot items with very few interactions. We propose a novel meta-learning framework&nbsp;ProtoCF&nbsp;that learns-to-compose robust prototype representations for few-shot items. ProtoCF utilizes episodic few-shot learning to extract meta-knowledge across a collection of diverse meta-training tasks designed to mimic item ranking within the tail. To further enhance discriminative power, we propose a novel architecture-agnostic technique based on knowledge distillation to extract, relate, and transfer knowledge from neural base recommenders. Our experimental results demonstrate that&nbsp;ProtoCF&nbsp;consistently outperforms state-of-art approaches on overall recommendation (by 5% Recall@50) while achieving significant gains (of 60-80% Recall@50) for tail items with less than 20 interactions.},

abstract = {Recommender systems nowadays have many applications and are of great economic benefit. Hence, it is imperative for success-oriented companies to compare various of such systems and select the better one for their purposes. To this end, various metrics of predictive accuracy are commonly used, such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or precision and recall. All these metrics more or less measure how well a recommender system can predict human behaviour. Unfortunately, human behaviour is always associated with some degree of uncertainty, making the evaluation difficult, since it is not clear whether a deviation is system-induced or just originates from the natural variability of human decision making. At this point, some authors speculated that we may be reaching some Magic Barrier where this variability prevents us from getting much more accurate [12, 13, 24]. In this article, we will extend the existing theory of the Magic Barrier [24] into a new probabilistic but a yet pragmatic model. In particular, we will use methods from metrology and physics to develop easy-to-handle quantities for computation to describe the Magic Barrier for different accuracy metrics and provide suggestions for common application. This discussion is substantiated by comprehensive experiments with real users and large-scale simulations on a high-performance cluster.},

A ranked list of items is obtained by minimizing a loss function that represents the uncertainty between training lists and output lists produced by a MF ranking model. ListRank-MF enjoys the advantage of low complexity and is analytically shown to be linear with the number of observed ratings for a given user-item matrix. We also experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of ListRank-MF by comparing its performance with that of item-based collaborative recommendation and a related state-of-the-art collaborative ranking approach (CoFiRank).},

In many modern Internet applications, we have a social network over the users of recommender systems, from which social information can be utilized to improve the accuracy of recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based matrix factorization model. Unlike most existing social recommender systems which use social information in the form of a regularizer on parameters of recommendation algorithms, we utilize the social information to densify the training data set by filling certain missing values (handle the data sparsity problem). In addition, by employing different pseudo rating generating criteria on cold start users and normal users, we can also partially solve the cold start problem effectively. Experiment results on real-world data sets demonstrated the superiority of our method over state-of-art approaches.},

abstract = {The sparsity of users' preferences can significantly degrade the quality of recommendations in the collaborative filtering strategy. To account for the fact that the selections of social friends and foes may improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a learning to rank model that exploits users' trust and distrust relationships. Our learning to rank model focusses on the performance at the top of the list, with the recommended items that end-users will actually see. In our model, we try to push the relevant items of users and their friends at the top of the list, while ranking low those of their foes. Furthermore, we propose a weighting strategy to capture the correlations of users' preferences with friends' trust and foes' distrust degrees in two intermediate trust- and distrust-preference user latent spaces, respectively. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset show that the proposed learning to rank model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of sparsity in users' preferences and when a part of trust and distrust relationships is not available. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crucial role of our weighting strategy in our model, to balance well the influences of friends and foes on users' preferences.},

Despite the raise of interest and work on the topic in recent years, we find that a clear common methodological and conceptual ground for the evaluation of these dimensions is still to be consolidated. Different evaluation metrics have been reported in the literature but the precise relation, distinction or equivalence between them has not been explicitly studied. Furthermore, the metrics reported so far miss important properties such as taking into consideration the ranking of recommended items, or whether items are relevant or not, when assessing the novelty and diversity of recommendations.We present a formal framework for the definition of novelty and diversity metrics that unifies and generalizes several state of the art metrics. We identify three essential ground concepts at the roots of novelty and diversity: choice, discovery and relevance, upon which the framework is built. Item rank and relevance are introduced through a probabilistic recommendation browsing model, building upon the same three basic concepts. Based on the combination of ground elements, and the assumptions of the browsing model, different metrics and variants unfold. We report experimental observations which validate and illustrate the properties of the proposed metrics.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the explanations. On one hand,&nbsp;current recommender systems model the recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built&nbsp;upon an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at inference due to the objective optimized at each&nbsp;conversation’s turn. We address these deficiencies with M&amp;Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate both&nbsp;fully&nbsp;and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the generalization ability of a trained M&amp;Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference and the critique separately. Our work’s most important innovation is our critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-supervised manner with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and multi-step critiquing. Moreover, M&amp;Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model&nbsp;infers coherent joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our multimodal-based modeling and training&nbsp;scheme.},

abstract = {Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a training time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further increases when also side information is considered for the computation of the recommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number of high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult to train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse factorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To achieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the dimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre, nationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an embedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the training process by letting users update only those relevant features on which they base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated by the user’s personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the approach’s effectiveness, considering the recommendation results’ accuracy, diversity, and induced bias. The public implementation of KGFlex is available at https://split.to/kgflex.},

abstract = {How to effectively mitigate the bias of feedback in recommender systems is an important research topic. In this paper, we first describe the generation process of the biased and unbiased feedback in recommender systems via two respective causal diagrams, where the difference between them can be regarded as the source of bias. We then define this difference as a confounding bias, which can be regarded as a collection of some specific biases that have previously been studied. For the case with biased feedback alone, we derive the conditions that need to be satisfied to obtain a debiased representation from the causal diagrams. Based on information theory, we propose a novel method called debiased information bottleneck (DIB) to optimize these conditions and then find a tractable solution for it. In particular, the proposed method constrains the model to learn a biased embedding vector with independent biased and unbiased components in the training phase, and uses only the unbiased component in the test phase to deliver more accurate recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a real product dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and discuss its properties.},

abstract = {For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, more and more attention has been paid to the sequence-based recommendation system, which is used to infer the evolution of users’ dynamic preferences, and recent studies have noticed that the evolution of users’ preferences can be better understood from the implicit and explicit feedback sequences. However, most of the existing recommendation techniques do not consider the noise contained in implicit feedback, which will lead to the biased representation of user interest and a suboptimal recommendation performance. Meanwhile, the existing methods utilize item sequence for capturing the evolution of user interest. The performance of these methods is limited by the length of the sequence, and can not effectively model the long-term interest in a long period of time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named denoising user-aware memory network (DUMN). Specifically, the framework: (i) proposes a feature purification module based on orthogonal mapping, which use the representation of explicit feedback to purify the representation of implicit feedback, and effectively denoise the implicit feedback; (ii) designs a user memory network to model the long-term interests in a fine-grained way by improving the memory network, which is ignored by the existing methods; and (iii) develops a preference-aware interactive representation component to fuse the long-term and short-term interests of users based on gating to understand the evolution of unbiased preferences of users. Extensive experiments on two real e-commerce user behavior datasets show that DUMN has a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines.},

But typically users are given no explicit control over this personalization, and are instead left guessing about how their actions affect the resulting recommendations. We hypothesize that any recommender algorithm will better fit some users' expectations than others, leaving opportunities for improvement. To address this challenge, we study a recommender that puts some control in the hands of users. Specifically, we build and evaluate a system that incorporates user-tuned popularity and recency modifiers, allowing users to express concepts like "show more popular items". We find that users who are given these controls evaluate the resulting recommendations much more positively. Further, we find that users diverge in their preferred settings, confirming the importance of giving control to users.},

abstract = {We propose a multi-modal content-based movie recommender system that replaces human-generated metadata with content descriptions automatically extracted from the visual and audio channels of a video. Content descriptors improve over traditional metadata in terms of both richness (it is possible to extract hundreds of meaningful features covering various modalities) and quality (content features are consistent across different systems and immune to human errors). Our recommender system integrates state-of-the-art aesthetic and deep visual features as well as block-level and i-vector audio features. For fusing the different modalities, we propose a rank aggregation strategy extending the Borda count approach.We evaluate the proposed multi-modal recommender system comprehensively against metadata-based baselines. To this end, we conduct two empirical studies: (i) a system-centric study to measure the offline quality of recommendations in terms of accuracy-related and beyond-accuracy performance measures (novelty, diversity, and coverage), and (ii) a user-centric online experiment, measuring different subjective metrics, including relevance, satisfaction, and diversity. In both studies, we use a dataset of more than 4,000 movie trailers, which makes our approach versatile. Our results shed light on the accuracy and beyond-accuracy performance of audio, visual, and textual features in content-based movie recommender systems.},

For the probabilistic neighborhood selection phase, we use an efficient method for weighted sampling of k neighbors that takes into consideration the similarity levels between the target user (or item) and the candidate neighbors. We conduct an empirical study showing that the proposed method increases the coverage, dispersion, and diversity reinforcement of recommendations by selecting diverse sets of representative neighbors. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms popular methods in terms of item prediction accuracy, utility-based ranking, and other popular measures, across various experimental settings.

abstract = {Recommender systems leverage user demographic information, such as age, gender, etc., to personalize recommendations and better place their targeted ads. Oftentimes, users do not volunteer this information due to privacy concerns, or due to a lack of initiative in filling out their online profiles. We illustrate a new threat in which a recommender learns private attributes of users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design both passive and active attacks that solicit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. Our methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that such attacks are indeed feasible and use significantly fewer rated items than static inference methods. Importantly, they succeed without sacrificing the quality of recommendations to users.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model for collaborative filtering applications. Our model is based on low-rank matrix factorization that uses a spatio-temporal filtering approach to estimate user and item factors. The spatial component regularizes the factors by exploiting correlation across users and/or items, modeled as a function of some implicit feedback (e.g., who rated what) and/or some side information (e.g., user demographics, browsing history). In particular, we incorporate correlation in factors through a Markov random field prior in a probabilistic framework, whereby the neighborhood weights are functions of user and item covariates. The temporal component ensures that the user/item factors adapt to process changes that occur through time and is implemented in a state space framework with fast estimation through Kalman filtering. Our spatio-temporal filtering (ST-KF hereafter) approach provides a single joint model to simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal structure in ratings and therefore provides an accurate method to predict future ratings. To ensure scalability of ST-KF, we employ a mean-field approximation for inference. Incorporating user/item covariates in estimating neighborhood weights also helps in dealing with both cold-start and warm-start problems seamlessly in a single unified modeling framework; covariates predict factors for new users and items through the neighborhood. We illustrate our method on simulated data, benchmark data and data obtained from a relatively new recommender system application arising in the context of Yahoo! Front Page.},

These elicitation techniques trade-off time and effort to users with the richness of the signal they provide to learning component driving the recommendations. In this paper, we explore this trade-off, seeking new ways for people to express their preferences with the goal of improving communication channels between users and the recommender system. Through a need-finding study, we observe the patterns in how people express their preferences during curation task, propose a taxonomy for organizing them, and point out research opportunities.

This work is based on the intuition that not all users behave in the same way -- instead there exist subsets of like-minded users. By using different item-item models for these user subsets, we can capture differences in their preferences and this can lead to improved performance for top-N recommendations. In this work, we extend SLIM by combining global and local SLIM models. We present a method that computes the prediction scores as a user-specific combination of the predictions derived by a global and local item-item models. We present an approach in which the global model, the local models, their user-specific combination, and the assignment of users to the local models are jointly optimized to improve the top-N recommendation performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves upon the standard SLIM model and outperforms competing top-N recommendation approaches.},

abstract = {Embedding based models have been the state of the art in collaborative filtering for over a decade. Traditionally, the dot product or higher order equivalents have been used to combine two or more embeddings, e.g., most notably in matrix factorization. In recent years, it was suggested to replace the dot product with a learned similarity e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice.},

abstract = {Improving the performance of recommender systems using knowledge graphs is an important task. There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering with implicit feedback is a ubiquitous class of recommendation problems where only positive interactions such as purchases or clicks are observed. Autoencoder-based recommendation models have shown strong performance on many implicit feedback benchmarks. However, these models tend to suffer from popularity bias making recommendations less personalized. User-generated reviews contain a rich source of preference information, often with specific details that are important to each user, and can help mitigate the popularity bias. Since not all reviews are equally useful, existing work has been exploring various forms of attention to distill relevant information. In the majority of proposed approaches, representations from implicit feedback and review branches are simply concatenated at the end to generate predictions. This can prevent the model from learning deeper correlations between the two modalities and affect prediction accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel Two-headed Attention Fused Autoencoder (TAFA) model that jointly learns representations from user reviews and implicit feedback to make recommendations. We apply early and late modality fusion which allows the model to fully correlate and extract relevant information from both input sources. To further combat popularity bias, we leverage the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective to “de-popularize” the fused user representation via a two-headed decoder architecture. Empirically, we show that TAFA outperforms leading baselines on multiple real-world benchmarks. Moreover, by tracing attention weights back to reviews we can provide explanations for the generated recommendations and gain further insights into user preferences.

In this work we describe a detailed analysis of a sparse, large scale dataset, specifically designed to push the envelope of recommender system models. The Yahoo! Music dataset consists of more than a million users, 600 thousand musical items and more than 250 million ratings, collected over a decade. It is characterized by three unique features: First, rated items are multi-typed, including tracks, albums, artists and genres; Second, items are arranged within a four level taxonomy, proving itself effective in coping with a severe sparsity problem that originates from the unusually large number of items (compared to, e.g., movie ratings datasets). Finally, fine resolution timestamps associated with the ratings enable a comprehensive temporal and session analysis. We further present a matrix factorization model exploiting the special characteristics of this dataset. In particular, the model incorporates a rich bias model with terms that capture information from the taxonomy of items and different temporal dynamics of music ratings. To gain additional insights of its properties, we organized the KddCup-2011 competition about this dataset. As the competition drew thousands of participants, we expect the dataset to attract considerable research activity in the future.},

abstract = {Heavily pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have recently shown to be remarkably powerful at language modelling, achieving impressive results on numerous downstream tasks. It has also been shown that they implicitly store factual knowledge in their parameters after pre-training. Understanding what the pre-training procedure of LMs actually learns is a crucial step for using and improving them for Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS). We first study how much off-the-shelf pre-trained BERT “knows” about recommendation items such as books, movies and music. In order to analyze the knowledge stored in BERT’s parameters, we use different probes (i.e., tasks to examine a trained model regarding certain properties) that require different types of knowledge to solve, namely content-based and collaborative-based. Content-based knowledge is knowledge that requires the model to match the titles of items with their content information, such as textual descriptions and genres. In contrast, collaborative-based knowledge requires the model to match items with similar ones, according to community interactions such as ratings. We resort to BERT’s Masked Language Modelling (MLM) head to probe its knowledge about the genre of items, with cloze style prompts. In addition, we employ BERT’s Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) head and representations’ similarity (SIM) to compare relevant and non-relevant search and recommendation query-document inputs to explore whether BERT can, without any fine-tuning, rank relevant items first. Finally, we study how BERT performs in a conversational recommendation downstream task. To this end, we fine-tune BERT to act as a retrieval-based CRS. Overall, our experiments show that: (i) BERT has knowledge stored in its parameters about the content of books, movies and music; (ii) it has more content-based knowledge than collaborative-based knowledge; and (iii) fails on conversational recommendation when faced with adversarial data.},

abstract = {Maximizing sales and revenue is an important goal of online commercial retailers. Recommender systems are designed to maximize users' click or purchase probability, but often disregard users' eventual satisfaction with purchased items. As result, such systems promote items with high appeal at the selling stage (e.g. an eyecatching presentation) over items that would yield more satisfaction to users in the long run. This work presents a novel unified model that considers both goals and can be tuned to balance between them according to the needs of the business scenario.We propose a multi-task probabilistic matrix factorization model with a dual task objective: predicting binary purchase/no purchase variables combined with predicting continuous satisfaction scores. Model parameters are optimized using Variational Bayes which allows learning a posterior distribution over model parameters. This model allows making predictions that balance the two goals of maximizing the probability for an immediate purchase and maximizing user satisfaction and engagement down the line. These goals lie at the heart of most commercial recommendation scenarios and enabling their balance has the potential to improve value for millions of users worldwide. Finally, we present experimental evaluation on different types of consumer retail datasets that demonstrate the benefits of the model over popular baselines on a number of well-known ranking metrics.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a multi-criteria recommender system based on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, which exploits the information conveyed by users' reviews to provide a multi-faceted representation of users' interests.To this end, we exploited a framework for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which automatically extracts relevant aspects and sentiment scores from users' reviews. As an example, in a restaurant recommendation scenario, the aspects may regard food quality, service, position, athmosphere of the place and so on. Such a multi-faceted representation of the user is used to feed a multi-criteria CF algorithm which predicts user interest in a particular item and provides her with recommendations.In the experimental session we evaluated the performance of the algorithm against several state-of-the-art baselines; Results confirmed the insight behind this work, since our approach was able to overcome both single-criteria recommendation algorithms as well as more sophisticated techniques based on matrix factorization.},

abstract = {The ranking quality at the top of the list is crucial in many real-world applications of recommender systems. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows for pointwise as well as listwise training with respect to various ranking metrics. This is based on a training objective function where we assume that, for given a user, the recommender system predicts scores for all items that follow approximately a Gaussian distribution. We motivate this assumption from the properties of implicit feedback data. As a model, we use matrix factorization and extend it by non-linear activation functions, as customary in the literature of artificial neural networks. In particular, we use non-linear activation functions derived from our Gaussian assumption. Our preliminary experimental results show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods with respect to optimizing the Area under the ROC curve, while it is particularly effective in optimizing the head of the ranked list.},

abstract = {Regularized matrix factorization models are known to generate high quality rating predictions for recommender systems. One of the major drawbacks of matrix factorization is that once computed, the model is static. For real-world applications dynamic updating a model is one of the most important tasks. Especially when ratings on new users or new items come in, updating the feature matrices is crucial.In this paper, we generalize regularized matrix factorization (RMF) to regularized kernel matrix factorization (RKMF). Kernels provide a flexible method for deriving new matrix factorization methods. Furthermore with kernels nonlinear interactions between feature vectors are possible. We propose a generic method for learning RKMF models. From this method we derive an online-update algorithm for RKMF models that allows to solve the new-user/new-item problem. Our evaluation indicates that our proposed online-update methods are accurate in approximating a full retrain of a RKMF model while the runtime of online-updating is in the range of milliseconds even for huge datasets like Netflix.},

Yokie uses the large volume of hyperlink-laden messages on social networks like Twitter as the basis of its content and ranking systems. Curated sets of users (or "Search Parties") form the basis of sourcing the content from the networks, and the metadata of the containing messages form the basis of ranking and contextual retrieval of the hyperlinks. Each hyperlink is in- dexed with a compound set of terms from multiple tweets (should the given hyperlink be shared more than once). This indexing step is a novel example of collaborative tagging of resources. The application is live with more than 100 users, who have performed approximately 1000 queries.

abstract = {Recommender Systems help an on-line user to tame information overload and are being used now in complex domains where it could be beneficial to exploit context-awareness, e.g., in travel recommendation. Technically, in Recommender Systems we can interpret context as a set of constraints or preferences over the usage of items determined by the contextual conditions (e.g., today it is raining or the user is in a particular location). In fact, there is a lack of approaches to deal effectively with contextual data. This thesis investigates some approaches to exploit context in Recommender Systems. It provides a general architecture of context-aware Recommender Systems and analyzes separate components of this model. The main focus is to investigate new approaches that can bring a real added value to users.

In the case of two base rankers, we show that the exponentially weighted combination achieves near optimal performance. However, the number of required points to be evaluated may be prohibitive with more base models in a real application. We propose a gradient based stochastic optimization algorithm that uses finite differences. Our new algorithm achieves similar empirical performance for two base rankers, while scaling well with an increased number of models. In our experiments with five real-world recommendation data sets, we show that the combination offers significant improvement over previously known stochastic optimization techniques. Our algorithm is the first effective stochastic optimization method for combining ranked recommendation lists by online machine learning.},

For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al.~recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true effectiveness of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have become the method of choice for researchers working on algorithmic aspects of recommender systems. With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models.In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems consider contextual features as additional information to predict user's preferences. For example, the recommendations could be based on time, location, or the company of other people. Among the contextual information, time became an important feature because user preferences tend to change over time or be similar in the near future. Researchers have proposed different models to incorporate time into their recommender system, however, the current models are not able to capture specific temporal patterns. To address the limitation observed in previous works, we propose Collective embedding for Neural Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CoNCARS). The proposed solution jointly model the item, user and time embeddings to capture temporal patterns. Then, CoNCARS use the outer product to model the user-item-time correlations between dimensions of the embedding space. The hidden features feed our Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn the non-linearities between the different features. Finally, we combine the output from our CNNs in the fusion layer and then predict the user's preference score. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating CoNCARS improves the top-N item recommendation task and outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.},

Yet explanations have been shown to improve the transparency of a recommender system by justifying recommendations, and this in turn can enhance the user's trust in the recommendations. Hence, one main challenge in designing a recommender system is mitigating the trade-off between an explainable technique with moderate prediction accuracy and a more accurate technique with no explainable recommendations. In this paper, we focus on factorization models and further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content or user attributes. We propose an explainability constrained MF technique that computes the top-n recommendation list from items that are explainable. Experimental results show that our method is effective in generating accurate and explainable recommendations.},

abstract = {The role of recommendation systems in the diversity of content consumption on platforms is a much-debated issue. The quantitative state of the art often overlooks the existence of individual attitudes toward guidance, and eventually of different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music streaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one year and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of recommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we compute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within their listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called ‘organic’ use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four categories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity, both in terms of dispersion – how much users consume the same content repeatedly – and popularity – how popular is the content they consume. We show that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms – algorithmic and editorial – may drive the consumption of more or less diverse content in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users. Finally, we compare users’ streaming histories with the music programming of a selection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio programs are usually more tilted toward repetition than users’ listening histories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the whole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated recommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of ‘filter niches’ rather than ‘filter bubbles’. They hint at further ramifications for the study and design of recommendation systems.},

abstract = {The Social Web is successfully established, and steadily growing in terms of users, content and services. People generate and consume data in real-time within social networking services, such as Twitter, and increasingly rely upon continuous streams of messages for real-time access to fresh knowledge about current affairs. In this paper, we focus on analyzing social streams in real-time for personalized topic recommendation and discovery. We consider collaborative filtering as an online ranking problem and present Stream Ranking Matrix Factorization - RMFX -, which uses a pairwise approach to matrix factorization in order to optimize the personalized ranking of topics. Our novel approach follows a selective sampling strategy to perform online model updates based on active learning principles, that closely simulates the task of identifying relevant items from a pool of mostly uninteresting ones. RMFX is particularly suitable for large scale applications and experiments on the "476 million Twitter tweets" dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's global trend, and it is also able to deliver highly competitive Top-N recommendations faster while using less space than Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a state-of-the-art matrix factorization technique for Collaborative Filtering, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.},

abstract = {In recommender systems based on low-rank factorization of a partially observed user-item matrix, a common phenomenon that plagues many otherwise effective models is the interleaving of good and spurious recommendations in the top-K results. A single spurious recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. Spurious recommendations do not result in serendipitous discoveries but rather cognitive dissonance. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to make inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate the folding metric definition on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. In studying the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems, we observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.},

abstract = {The multi-armed bandit is an important framework for balancing exploration with exploitation in recommendation. Exploitation recommends content (e.g., products, movies, music playlists) with the highest predicted user engagement and has traditionally been the focus of recommender systems. Exploration recommends content with uncertain predicted user engagement for the purpose of gathering more information. The importance of exploration has been recognized in recent years, particularly in settings with new users, new items, non-stationary preferences and attributes. In parallel, explaining recommendations ("recsplanations") is crucial if users are to understand their recommendations. Existing work has looked at bandits and explanations independently. We provide the first method that combines both in a principled manner. In particular, our method is able to jointly (1) learn which explanations each user responds to; (2) learn the best content to recommend for each user; and (3) balance exploration with exploitation to deal with uncertainty. Experiments with historical log data and tests with live production traffic in a large-scale music recommendation service show a significant improvement in user engagement.},

The emerging trend of social networking sites and their accommodation in other sites like e-commerce can potentially help alleviate the sparsity problem with their provided social relation data. In this paper, we have particularly explored a new kind of social relation, the membership, and its combined effect with friendship. The two type of heterogeneous social relations are fused into the CF recommender via a factorization process. Due to the two relations' respective properties, we adopt different fusion strategies: regularization was leveraged for friendship and collective matrix factorization (CMF) was proposed for incorporating membership. We further developed a unified model to combine the two relations together and tested it with real large-scale datasets at five sparsity levels. The experiment has not only revealed the significant effect of the two relations, especially the membership, in augmenting recommendation accuracy in the sparse data condition, but also identified the ability of our fusing model in achieving the desired fusion performance.},

In this paper, to overcome the aforementioned drawback, we first formulate the relationships between users and items as a bipartite graph. Then, we propose a new spectral convolution operation directly performing in the spectral domain, where not only the proximity information of a graph but also the connectivity information hidden in the graph are revealed. With the proposed spectral convolution operation, we build a deep recommendation model called Spectral Collaborative Filtering (SpectralCF). Benefiting from the rich information of connectivity existing in the spectral domain, SpectralCF is capable of discovering deep connections between users and items and therefore, alleviates the cold-start problem for CF. To the best of our knowledge, SpectralCF is the first CF-based method directly learning from the spectral domains of user-item bipartite graphs. We apply our method on several standard datasets. It is shown that SpectralCF significantly out-performs state-of-the-art models. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lzheng21/SpectralCF.},

As the number and dimensionality of these vectors keeps increasing, however, currently existing approaches are often unable to meet the strict efficiency requirements imposed by the environments they need to perform in. Real-time neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering (CF) is one example of such an environment in which performance is critical.In this work, we present a novel algorithm for efficient and exact similarity computation between sparse, high-dimensional vectors. Our approach exploits the sparsity that is inherent to implicit feedback data-streams, entailing significant gains compared to other methods. Furthermore, as our model learns incrementally, it is naturally suited for dynamic real-time CF environments. We propose a MapReduce-inspired parallellisation procedure along with our method, and show how even more speed-up can be achieved. Additionally, in many real-world systems, many items are actually not recommendable at any given time, due to recency, stock, seasonality, or enforced business rules. We exploit this fact to further improve the computational efficiency of our approach. Experimental evaluation on both real-world and publicly available datasets shows that our approach scales up to millions of processed user-item interactions per second, and well advances the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations are computed by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items. It assumes that the users' previously recorded ratings can help in predicting future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains item ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time or the goal of the item consumption. This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting. In this approach, the ratings of certain items are split, according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition. Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one. We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings.},

abstract = {In item-based collaborative filtering, a critical intermediate step to personalized recommendations is the definition of an item-similarity metric. Existing algorithms compute the item-similarity using the user-to-item ratings (cosine, Pearson, Jaccard, etc.). When computing the similarity between two items A and B many of these algorithms divide the actual number of co-occurring users by some "difficulty" of co-occurrence. We refine this approach by defining item similarity as the ratio of the actual number of co-occurrences to the number of co-occurrences that would be expected if user choices were random. In the final step of our method to compute personalized recommendations we apply the usage history of a user to the item similarity matrix. The well defined probabilistic meaning of our similarities allows us to further improve this final step. We measured the quality of our algorithm on a large real-world data-set. As part of Comcast's efforts to improve its personalized recommendations of movies and TV shows, several top recommender companies were invited to apply their algorithms to one year of Video-on-Demand usage data. Our algorithm tied for first place. This paper includes a MapReduce pseudo code implementation of our algorithm.},

We report on preliminary experiments with this modified objective, in which the minimisation is carried out using stochastic gradient descent.

abstract = {Matrix factorization is widely used in Recommender Systems. Although existing popular incremental matrix factorization methods are effectively in reducing time complexity, they simply assume that the similarity between items or users is invariant. For instance, they keep the item feature matrix unchanged and just update the user matrix without re-training the entire model. However, with the new users growing continuously, the fitting error would be accumulated since the extra distribution information of items has not been utilized. In this paper, we present an alternative and reasonable approach, with a relaxed assumption that the similarity between items (users) is relatively stable after updating. Concretely, utilizing the prediction error of the new data as the auxiliary features, our method updates both feature matrices simultaneously, and thus users' preference can be better modeled than merely adjusting one corresponded feature matrix. Besides, our method maintains the feature dimension in a smaller size through taking advantage of matrix sketching. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the existing incremental matrix factorization methods.},

abstract = {The application a smart phone user will launch next intuitively depends on the sequence of apps used recently. More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the current context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session interactional context. It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic representational context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the methodname algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate context bias, in addition to click bias (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20.},

abstract = {Recommender systems provide consumers with ratings of items. These ratings are based on a set of ratings that were obtained from a wide scope of users. Predicting the ratings can be formulated as a regression problem. Ensemble regression methods are effective tools that improve the results of simple regression algorithms by iteratively applying the simple algorithm to a diverse set of inputs. The present paper describes a simple and effective ensemble regressor for the prediction of missing ratings in recommender systems. The ensemble method is an adaptation of the AdaBoost regression algorithm for recommendation tasks. In all iterations, interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors are simultaneously derived by minimizing the root mean squared error. From iteration to iteration instances that are hard to predict are reinforced by manipulating their weights in the goal function that needs to be minimized. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the ensemble methodology significantly improves the predictive performance of single neighborhood-based collaborative filtering.},

We show how individual users can be represented in addition to sequences of consumed items in a new type of Gated Recurrent Unit to effectively produce personalized next item recommendations.

We evaluate the proposed algorithms in an off-line experiment by using various contextually-tagged rating datasets. We illustrate some significant performance differences between the considered algorithms and show that they can be effectively combined into the proposed switching hybrid to cope with different types of cold-start problems.},

MF models decompose the observed user-item interaction matrix into user and item latent factors. In this paper, we propose a co-factorization model, CoFactor, which jointly decomposes the user-item interaction matrix and the item-item co-occurrence matrix with shared item latent factors. For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix. We show that this model significantly improves the performance over MF models on several datasets with little additional computational overhead. We provide qualitative results that explain how CoFactor improves the quality of the inferred factors and characterize the circumstances where it provides the most significant improvements.},

Recent advances have made recommender systems essential to various online applications, such as e-commerce, social networks, and review service websites. However, practical systems mainly focus on recommending inner-site homogeneous items. For example, a movie review website usually recommends other movies within the site when a user has enjoyed a movie online. However, it would be exciting if the system recommends some attractive products related to this movie from some e-commerce websites like Amazon or eBay.Such an ability to provide heterogeneous cross-site recommendations may shed light on brand new and promising business models, which could benefit both the online shops in expanding the marketing efforts, and the online users in discovering items of interest from a wider scope. In this research, we propose and formalize the problem of universal recommendation, record and analyze user browsing actions in web browsers, and provide browser-oriented cross-site recommendations when the users are surfing online.},

They suffer from a common yet critical drawback, i.e., the model has to be re-trained completely from scratch whenever new training data arrives, which is clearly non-scalable for large real recommender systems where users' rating data often arrives sequentially and frequently. In this paper, we investigate a novel efficient and scalable online collaborative filtering technique for on-the-fly recommender systems, which is able to effectively online update the recommendation model from a sequence of rating observations. Specifically, we propose a family of online multi-task collaborative filtering (OMTCF) algorithms, which tackle the online collaborative filtering task by exploiting the similar principle as online multitask learning. Encouraging empirical results on large-scale datasets showed that the proposed technique is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {The new user coldstart problem arises when a recommender system does not yet have any information about a user. A common solution to it is to generate a profile by asking the user to rate a number of items. Which items are selected determines the quality of the recommendations made, and thus has been studied extensively. We propose a new elicitation method to generate a static preference questionnaire (SPQ) that poses relative preference questions to the user. Using a latent factor model, we show that SPQ improves personalized recommendations by choosing a minimal and diverse set of questions. We are the first to rigorously prove which optimization task should be solved to select each question in static questionnaires. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive experimentation. We test the performance of SPQ on two real-world datasets, under two experimental conditions: simulated, when users behave according to a latent factor model (LFM), and real, in which only real user judgments are revealed as the system asks questions. We show that SPQ reduces the necessary length of a questionnaire by up to a factor of three compared to state-of-the-art preference elicitation methods. Moreover, solving the right optimization task, SPQ also performs better than baselines with dynamically generated questions.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF), one of the most successful recommendation approaches, continues to attract interest in both academia and industry. However, one key issue limiting the success of collaborative filtering in certain application domains is the cold-start problem, a situation where historical data is too sparse (known as the sparsity problem), new users have not rated enough items (known as the new user problem), or both. In this paper, we aim at addressing the cold-start problem by incorporating human personality into the collaborative filtering framework. We propose three approaches: the first is a recommendation method based on users' personality information alone; the second is based on a linear combination of both personality and rating information; and the third uses a cascade mechanism to leverage both resources. To evaluate their effectiveness, we have conducted an experimental study comparing the proposed approaches with the traditional rating-based CF in two cold-start scenarios: sparse data sets and new users. Our results show that the proposed CF variations, which consider personality characteristics, can significantly improve the performance of the traditional rating-based CF in terms of the evaluation metrics MAE and ROC sensitivity.},

This important property is known as calibration, and recently received renewed attention in the context of fairness in machine learning. In the recommended list of items, calibration ensures that the various (past) areas of interest of a user are reflected with their corresponding proportions. Calibration is especially important in light of the fact that recommender systems optimized toward accuracy (e.g., ranking metrics) in the usual offline-setting can easily lead to recommendations where the lesser interests of a user get crowded out by the user's main interests-which we show empirically as well as in thought-experiments. This can be prevented by calibrated recommendations. To this end, we outline metrics for quantifying the degree of calibration, as well as a simple yet effective re-ranking algorithm for post-processing the output of recommender systems.},

Ranking the items in social media websites based on the amount of user participation in them, can be used in different applications, such as recommender systems. In this paper, we consider a tweet containing a rating for a movie as an instance and focus on ranking the instances of each user based on their engagement, i.e., the total number of retweets and favorites it will gain.For this task, we define several features which can be extracted from the meta-data of each tweet. The features are partitioned into three categories: user-based, movie-based, and tweet-based. We show that in order to obtain good results, features from all categories should be considered. We exploit regression and learning to rank methods to rank the tweets and propose to aggregate the results of regression and learning to rank methods to achieve better performance.We have run our experiments on an extended version of MovieTweeting dataset provided by ACM RecSys Challenge 2014. The results show that learning to rank approach outperforms most of the regression models and the combination can improve the performance significantly.},

Finally, we discuss how our model highlights the importance of collecting data on user beliefs and their evolution over time both to design better recommendations and to further understand their impact.},

Nonetheless, these approaches suffer from severe time and space requirements, which can be alleviated via random walk sampling, at the cost of reduced recommendation quality. In addition, these approaches ignore users' ratings, which further limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient graph-based approach for collaborative filtering based on short-path enumeration. Moreover, we propose three scoring functions based on the Bayesian paradigm that effectively exploit distributional aspects of the users' ratings. We experiment with seven publicly available datasets against state-of-the-art graph-based and matrix factorization approaches. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in most settings. Furthermore, analytical results demonstrate its efficiency compared to other graph-based approaches.},

Recommendation engines that automatically configure such objects given user preferences and constraints, may provide much value in such cases. These applications generate appropriate recommendations based on user preferences. It is likely, though, that the user will not be able to fully express her preferences and constraints, requiring a phase of manual tuning of the recommended configuration. We suggest that following this manual revision, additional constraints and preferences can be automatically collected, and the recommended configuration can be automatically improved. Specifically, we suggest a recommender component that takes as input an initial manual configuration of a complex object, deduces certain user preferences and constraints from this configuration, and constructs an alternative configuration. We show an appealing application for our method in complex trip planning, and demonstrate its usability in a user study.},

In this paper, we show how a recently introduced statistical relational learning framework can be used to develop a generic and extensible hybrid recommender system. Our hybrid approach, HyPER (HYbrid Probabilistic Extensible Recommender), incorporates and reasons over a wide range of information sources. Such sources include multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and social information. HyPER automatically learns to balance these different information signals when making predictions. We build our system using a powerful and intuitive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic, which enables efficient and accurate prediction by formulating our custom recommender systems with a scalable class of graphical models known as hinge-loss Markov random fields. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two popular recommendation datasets, showing that HyPER can effectively combine multiple information types for improved performance, and can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {The efficient, distributed factorization of large matrices on clusters of commodity machines is crucial to applying latent factor models in industrial-scale recommender systems. We propose an efficient, data-parallel low-rank matrix factorization with Alternating Least Squares which uses a series of broadcast-joins that can be efficiently executed with MapReduce.We empirically show that the performance of our solution is suitable for real-world use cases. We present experiments on two publicly available datasets and on a synthetic dataset termed Bigflix, generated from the Netflix dataset. Bigflix contains 25 million users and more than 5 billion ratings, mimicking data sizes recently reported as Netflix' production workload. We demonstrate that our approach is able to run an iteration of Alternating Least Squares in six minutes on this dataset. Our implementation has been contributed to the open source machine learning library Apache Mahout.},

abstract = {Though most recommender systems make suggestions for individual users, in many circumstances the selected items (e.g., movies) are not for personal usage but rather for consumption in group. In this paper, we present a recommender system for audio-visual content that generates suggestions for groups of people (such as families or friends) in the home environment. In this context, different group recommendation strategies are evaluated for various algorithms and sizes of the group. An offline evaluation proves the assumption that for randomly composed groups the accuracy of all recommendation algorithms decreases if the group size grows. Besides, the results show that the group recommendation strategy which produces the most accurate results is depending on the algorithm that is used for generating individual recommendations. Consequently, if an existing recommender system for individuals is extended to a recommender system for groups, the group recommendation strategy has to be chosen based on the utilized recommendation algorithm in order to maximize the efficiency of the group recommendations.},

The former method focuses on analyzing the item-based recommendation network. The aim is to detect whether the network topology has any pathology that hinders novel recommendations. The latter, user-centric evaluation, aims at measuring users' perceived quality of novel, previously unknown, recommendations.The results of the experiments, done in the music recommendation context, show that last.fm social recommender, based on collaborative filtering, is prone to popularity bias. This has direct consequences on the topology of the item-based recommendation network. Pure audio content-based methods (CB) are not affected by popularity. However, a user-centric experiment done with 288 subjects shows that even though a social-based approach recommends less novel items than our CB, users' perceived quality is better than those recommended by a pure CB method.},

Unlike an individual's personal interests, what a user is known for is reflected by the views of others, and is often not easily discerned for a long-tail of the vast majority of users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering what users are known for through a probabilistic model called Bayesian Contextual Poisson Factorization. Moving beyond just modeling user's content, it naturally models and integrates additional contextual factors, concretely, user's geo-spatial footprints and social influence, to overcome noisy online activities and social relations. Through GPS-tagged social media datasets, we find that the proposed method can improve known-for prediction performance by 17.5% in precision and 20.9% in recall on average, and that it can capture the implicit relationships between a user's known-for profile and her content, geo-spatial and social influence.},

The goal is to suggest new links that will be perceived as positive by users. However, as signed social networks and newer content services become common, it is important to distinguish between positive and negative preferences. Even in existing applications, the cost of a negative recommendation could be high when people are looking for new jobs, friends, or places to live.In this work, we develop novel probabilistic latent factor models to recommend positive links and compare them with existing methods on five different openly available datasets. Our models are able to produce better ranking lists and are effective in the task of ranking positive links at the top, with fewer negative links (flops). Moreover, we find that modeling signed social networks and user preferences this way has the advantage of increasing the diversity of recommendations. We also investigate the effect of regularization on the quality of recommendations, a matter that has not received enough attention in the literature. We find that regularization parameter heavily affects the quality of recommendations in terms of both accuracy and diversity.},

However, in some circumstances the items to be selected are not intended for personal usage but for a group; e.g., a DVD could be watched by a group of friends. In order to generate effective recommendations for a group the system must satisfy, as much as possible, the individual preferences of the group's members.This paper analyzes the effectiveness of group recommendations obtained aggregating the individual lists of recommendations produced by a collaborative filtering system. We compare the effectiveness of individual and group recommendation lists using normalized discounted cumulative gain. It is observed that the effectiveness of a group recommendation does not necessarily decrease when the group size grows. Moreover, when individual recommendations are not effective a user could obtain better suggestions looking at the group recommendations. Finally, it is shown that the more alike the users in the group are, the more effective the group recommendations are.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of domains such as movies, music, news, products, restaurants, etc. While a typical recommender system bases its recommendations solely on users' preference data collected by the system itself, the quality of recommendations can significantly be improved if several recommender systems (or vendors) share their data. However, such data sharing poses significant privacy and security challenges, both to the vendors and the users. In this paper we propose secure protocols for distributed item-based Collaborative Filtering. Our protocols allow to compute both the predicted ratings of items and their predicted rankings, without compromising privacy nor predictions' accuracy. Unlike previous solutions in which the secure protocols are executed solely by the vendors, our protocols assume the existence of a mediator that performs intermediate computations on encrypted data supplied by the vendors. Such a mediated setting is advantageous over the non-mediated one since it enables each vendor to communicate solely with the mediator. This yields reduced communication costs and it allows each vendor to issue recommendations to its clients without being dependent on the availability and willingness of the other vendors to collaborate.},

abstract = {Automated course recommendation can help deliver personalized and effective college advising and degree planning. Nearest neighbor and matrix factorization based collaborative filtering approaches have been applied to student-course grade data to help students select suitable courses. However, the student-course enrollment patterns exhibit grouping structures that are tied to the student and course academic features, which lead to grade data that are not missing at random (NMAR). Existing approaches for dealing with NMAR data, such as Response-aware and context-aware matrix factorization, do not model NMAR data in terms of the user and item features and are not designed with the characteristics of grade data in mind. In this work we investigate how the student and course academic features influence the enrollment patterns and we use these features to define student and course groups at various levels of granularity. We show how these groups can be used to design grade prediction and top-n course ranking models for neighborhood-based user collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and popularity-based ranking approaches. These methods give lower grade prediction error and more accurate top-n course rankings than the other methods that do not take domain knowledge into account.},

By analyzing usage data, these methods uncover our latent preferences for items (such as articles or movies) and form recommendations based on the behavior of others with similar tastes. But traditional preference-based recommendations do not account for the social aspect of consumption, where a trusted friend might point us to an interesting item that does not match our typical preferences. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between preference- and social-based recommendations. We develop social Poisson factorization (SPF), a probabilistic model that incorporates social network information into a traditional factorization method; SPF introduces the social aspect to algorithmic recommendation. We develop a scalable algorithm for analyzing data with SPF, and demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods on six real-world datasets; data sources include a social reader and Etsy.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is an effective recommendation technique, which selects items for an individual user based on similar users' preferences. However, CF may not fully reflect the procedure how people choose an item in real life, for users are more likely to ask friends for opinions instead of asking similar strangers. Recently, some recommendation methods based on social network have been raised. These approaches incorporate social network into the CF algorithms and users' preferences can be influenced by the favors of their friends. These social approaches require the knowledge of similarities among friends. There are two popular similarity functions: Vector Space Similarity (VSS) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). However, both friends similarity functions are based on the item-sets they rated in common. In most cases, these functions are impractical, i.e. if two friends do not share the same items in common, the similarity between them will be zeros. To solve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Social Similarity (ASS) function based on the matrix factorization technique. We conduct our experiment on a large dataset: Epinions, which is a widely-used dataset with social information. The experiment results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline models and achieves a better performance than social-based method in [4].},

abstract = {A major challenge in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is how to provide recommendations when rating data is sparse or entirely missing for a subset of users or items, commonly known as the cold-start problem. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing new solutions that address the cold-start problem. These solutions are mainly based on the idea of exploiting other sources of information to compensate for the lack of rating data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on matrix factorization that simultaneously exploits the similarity information among users and items to alleviate the cold-start problem. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed algorithm decouples the following two aspects of the cold-start problem: (a) the completion of a rating sub-matrix, which is generated by excluding cold-start users and items from the original rating matrix; and (b) the transduction of knowledge from existing ratings to cold-start items/users using side information. This crucial difference significantly boosts the performance when appropriate side information is incorporated. We provide theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the proposed two-stage algorithm based on the richness of similarity information in capturing the rating data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the cold-start problem with provable guarantees. We also conduct thorough experiments on synthetic and real datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlights the usefulness of auxiliary information in dealing with both cold-start users and items.},

Homophily---the tendency for people to associate or interact with similar peers---and social influence---the tendency to adopt certain characteristics of those with whom one interacts---suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, preference-oriented social networks, that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network. We exploit these predictions in a social choice context to make group decisions or recommendations even when the preferences of some group members are unobserved.

We propose a novel algorithm called RankSLDA which extends the supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model by considering a learning-to-rank paradigm. This allows us to exploit the inherent collaborative effects that are present in CQA communities where users tend to answer questions in their topics of expertise. Users can thus be modeled on the basis of the topics in which they demonstrate expertise. In the supervised stage of the method we model the pairwise order of expertise of users on a given question. We compare RankSLDA against several alternative methods on data from the Cross Validate community, part of the Stack Exchange network. RankSLDA outperforms all alternative methods by a significant margin.},

abstract = {The significance of social-enhanced recommender systems is increasing, along with its practicality, as online reviews, ratings, friendship links, and follower relationships are increasingly becoming available. In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general collaborative social ranking model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed PushTrust. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.},

While considerable previous research has focused on finding topical experts with broad appeal -- e.g., top Java developers, best lawyers in Texas -- we tackle the problem of personalized expert recommendation, to identify experts who have special personal appeal and importance to users. One of the key insights motivating our approach is to leverage the geo-spatial preferences of users and the variation of these preferences across different regions, topics, and social communities. Through a fine-grained GPS-tagged social media trace, we characterize these geo-spatial preferences for personalized experts, and integrate these preferences into a matrix factorization-based personalized expert recommender. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed approach can improve the quality of recommendation by 24% in precision compared to several baselines. We also find that users' geo-spatial preference of expertise and their underlying social communities can ameliorate the cold start problem by more than 20% in precision and recall.},

abstract = {We propose a novel trust metric for social networks which is suitable for application to recommender systems. It is personalised and dynamic, and allows to compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based on the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some personalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics. In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical validation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the performance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {We argue that most recommendation approaches can be abstracted as a graph exploration problem. In particular, we describe a graph-theoretic framework with two primary parts: (a) a recommendation graph, modeling all the elements of an (application) domain from a recommendation perspective, including the subjects and objects of recommendations as well as the relationships between them; (b) a set of path operations, inferring new edges, i.e., implicit or unknown relationships, by traversing and combining paths on the graph. The resulting path algebra model provides an abstraction and a common foundation that is beneficial to three aspects of recommendations: (a) expressive power - expression and subsequent use of several significantly different, existing but also novel recommendation approaches is reduced to parameterizing a unique model; (b) usability - by capturing part of the recommendation mechanisms in the underlying path algebra semantics, specification of recommendation approaches becomes easier and less tedious; (c) processing speed - implementing recommender systems on top of graph engines opens up the door for several optimizations that speed up execution. We demonstrate the above benefits by expressing several categories of recommendation approaches in the path algebra model and benchmarking some of them in a recommender system implemented on top of Neo4J, a widely used graph system.},

Current collaborative filtering algorithms are accurate but also computationally expensive, and so are best in static off-line settings. It is desirable to include the new data in a collaborative filtering model in an online manner, requiring a model that can be incrementally updated efficiently. Incremental collaborative filtering via co-clustering has been shown to be a very scalable approach for this purpose. However, locally optimized co-clustering solutions via current fast iterative algorithms give poor accuracy. We propose an evolutionary co-clustering method that improves predictive performance while maintaining the scalability of co-clustering in the online phase.},

abstract = {Two flavors of the recommendation problem are the explicit and the implicit feedback settings. In the explicit feedback case, users rate items and the user-item preference relationship can be modelled on the basis of the ratings. In the harder but more common implicit feedback case, the system has to infer user preferences from indirect information: presence or absence of events, such as a user viewed an item. One approach for handling implicit feedback is to minimize a ranking objective function instead of the conventional prediction mean squared error. The naive minimization of a ranking objective function is typically expensive. This difficulty is usually overcome by a trade-off: sacrificing the accuracy to some extent for computational efficiency by sampling the objective function. In this paper, we present a computationally effective approach for the direct minimization of a ranking objective function, without sampling. We demonstrate by experiments on the Y!Music and Netflix data sets that the proposed method outperforms other implicit feedback recommenders in many cases in terms of the ErrorRate, ARP and Recall evaluation metrics.},

The most common approach generates recommendations based on user consumption patterns and on rating information gathered during each user-item interaction. In this paper we introduce a novel approach based on views of items, which are basically more complex models of the user-item interactions aimed at capturing the aspects on which users base their ratings. The resulting view-based approach recommends views to users instead of the traditional items. The proposed algorithms are tested on an artificial database, and the results show that modeling further interaction information improves the accuracy of predictions, provides a robust background to explain recommendations, exposes users to more specific recommendations and leads to better models of user preferences.},

abstract = {Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings: a matrix factorization that exploits items' properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement. The experimental results on two item cold-start use cases: news recommendation and email recipient recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show that it significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art methods for item cold-start.},

With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely "cold"' items.

Thousands of people share or distribute their music collections on the Internet, resulting in an explosive increase of information and more user dependence on automatic recommender systems. Though there are many techniques such as collaborative filtering, most approaches focus mainly on users' global behaviors, neglecting local actions and the specific properties of music. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective local implicit feedback model mining users' local preferences to get better recommendation performance in both rating and ranking prediction. Moreover, we design an efficient training algorithm to speed up the updating procedure, and give a method to find the most appropriate time granularity to assist the performance. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of this model, which show that it outperforms baseline model significantly. Integration with existing temporal models achieves a great improvement compared to the reported best single model for Yahoo! Music.},

To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach, Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is a well-known information retrieval metric for measuring the performance of top-k recommendations. We achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric. Experiments on two social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of CLiMF, and show that CLiMF significantly outperforms a naive baseline and two state-of-the-art CF methods.},

abstract = {Performing accurate suggestions is an objective of paramount importance for effective recommender systems. Other important and increasingly evident objectives are novelty and diversity, which are achieved by recommender systems that are able to suggest diversified items not easily discovered by the users. Different recommendation algorithms have particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each of these objectives, motivating the construction of hybrid approaches. However, most of these approaches only focus on optimizing accuracy, with no regard for novelty and diversity. The problem of combining recommendation algorithms grows significantly harder when multiple objectives are considered simultaneously. For instance, devising multi-objective recommender systems that suggest items that are simultaneously accurate, novel and diversified may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, where the attempt to improve an objective further may result in worsening other competing objectives. In this paper we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines existing algorithms which differ in their level of accuracy, novelty and diversity. We employ an evolutionary search for hybrids following the Strength Pareto approach, which isolates hybrids that are not dominated by others (i.e., the so called Pareto frontier). Experimental results on two recommendation scenarios show that: (i) we can combine recommendation algorithms in order to improve an objective without significantly hurting other objectives, and (ii) we allow for adjusting the compromise between accuracy, diversity and novelty, so that the recommendation emphasis can be adjusted dynamically according to the needs of different users.},

One of the most accurate and scalable collaborative filtering algorithms is matrix factorization, which is based on a latent factor model. We propose a novel Euclidean embedding method as an alternative latent factor model to implement collaborative filtering. In this method, users and items are embedded in a unified Euclidean space where the distance between a user and an item is inversely proportional to the rating. This model is comparable to matrix factorization in terms of both scalability and accuracy while providing several advantages. First, the result of Euclidean embedding is more intuitively understandable for humans, allowing useful visualizations. Second, the neighborhood structure of the unified Euclidean space allows very efficient recommendation queries. Finally, the method facilitates online implementation requirements such as mapping new users or items in an existing model. Our experimental results confirm these advantages and show that collaborative filtering via Euclidean embedding is a promising approach for online recommender systems.},

abstract = {The 2017 ACM RecSys Challenge focuses on the problem of job recommendations on XING in a cold-start scenario. In this paper we describe our solution as well as some practical lessons learned from the competition. We model this task as a binary classification problem. Negative candidate selection is the first key phase in our solution. We design a negative sampling strategy which performs significantly better than taking users' deleted or unclicked items as negative candidates. We then extract comprehensive features to model the relationship between a user-job candidate, including the direct profile similarity between the user and the job, and the profile similarity between the user's historical interested jobs and the target job. To make the whole pipeline scalable and easy to deploy online, we decide to use a single boosting tree model as the final discriminative model, instead of using a stacking ensemble of multiple models. Overall our model ranked 5th on the challenge leaderboard, and our last model has remained in 2nd place during the last two online weeks. We have open-sourced our implementation on https://github.com/Leavingseason/RecsysChallenge2017.},

abstract = {User demographics, such as age, gender and ethnicity, are routinely used for targeting content and advertising products to users. Similarly, recommender systems utilize user demographics for personalizing recommendations and overcoming the cold-start problem. Often, privacy-concerned users do not provide these details in their online profiles. In this work, we show that a recommender system can infer the gender of a user with high accuracy, based solely on the ratings provided by users (without additional metadata), and a relatively small number of users who share their demographics. Focusing on gender, we design techniques for effectively adding ratings to a user's profile for obfuscating the user's gender, while having an insignificant effect on the recommendations provided to that user.},

abstract = {Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) methods suffer from sparse or even cold-start problems, especially for new established recommenders. However, since there are now quite a few recommender systems already existing in good working order, their data should be valuable to the new-start recommenders. This paper proposes shared collaborative filtering approach to leverage the data from other parties (contributor party) to improve own (beneficiary party's) CF performance, and at the same time the privacy of other parties cannot be compromised. Item neighborhood list is chosen as the shared data from the contributor party with considering differential privacy. And an innovative algorithm called neighborhood boosting is proposed to make the beneficiary party leverage the shared data. MovieLens and Netflix data sets are considered as two parties to simulate and evaluate the proposed shared CF approach. The experiment results validate the positive effects of shared CF for increasing the recommendation accuracy of the beneficiary party. Especially when the beneficiary party's data is quite sparse, the performance can be increased by around 10%. The experiments also show that shared CF even outperforms the methods that incorporate the detailed original rating scores of the contributor party without considering the privacy issues. The proposed shared CF approach obtains a win-win situation for both performance and privacy.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a market-based approach for seeding recommendations for new items in which publishers bid to have items presented to the most influential users for each item. Users are able to select (or not) items for rating on an earn-per-rating basis, with payment given for providing a rating regardless of whether the rating is positive or negative. This approach reduces the time taken to obtain ratings for new items, while encouraging users to give honest ratings (to increase their influence) which in turn supports the quality of recommendations. To support this approach we propose techniques for inferring the social influence network from users' rating vectors and recommendation lists. Using this influence network we apply existing heuristics for estimating a user's influence, adapting them to account for the new items already presented to a user. We also propose an extension to Chen et al.'s Degree Discount heuristic [Chen et al. 2009], to enable it to be used in this context. We evaluate our approach on the MovieLens dataset and show that we are able to reduce the time taken to achieve coverage, while supporting the quality of recommendations.},

abstract = {Previous work on using external aggregate rating information showed that this information can be incorporated in several different types of recommender systems and improves their performance. In this paper, we propose a more general class of methods that combine external aggregate information with individual ratings in a novel way. Unlike the previously proposed methods, one of the defining features of this approach is that it takes into the consideration not only the aggregate average ratings but also the variance of the aggregate distribution of ratings. The methods proposed in this paper estimate unknown ratings by finding an optimal linear combination of individual-level and aggregate-level rating estimators in a form of a hierarchical regression (HR) model that is grounded in the theory of statistics and machine learning.The proposed HR model is general enough so that the standard individual-level recommender systems and naive aggregate methods constitute special cases of this model.We show that for the general HR model, the presence of the aggregate variance, surprisingly, does not significantly improve estimation of unknown ratings vis-a-vis the case when only aggregate average ratings are considered.In the paper, we experimentally show that the optimal linear combination approach significantly dominates all other special cases, including the classical non-aggregated case and our previously studied aggregate methods, and therefore is the method of choice.},

abstract = {User-based collaborative filtering methods typically predict a user's item ratings as a weighted average of the ratings given by similar users, where the weight is proportional to the user similarity. Therefore, the accuracy of user similarity is the key to the success of the recommendation, both for selecting neighborhoods and computing predictions. However, the computed similarities between users are somewhat inaccurate due to data sparsity.For a given user, the set of neighbors selected for predicting ratings on different items typically exhibit overlap. Thus, error terms contributing to rating predictions will tend to be shared, leading to correlation of the prediction errors.Through a set of case studies, we discovered that for a given user, the prediction errors on different items are correlated to the similarities of the corresponding items, and to the degree to which they share common neighbors.We propose a framework to improve prediction accuracy based on these statistical prediction errors. Two different strategies to estimate the prediction error on a desired item are proposed. Our experiments show that these approaches improve the prediction accuracy of standard user based methods significantly, and they outperform other state-of-the-art methods.},

Then recommendations for the tail items are based on the ratings in these clusters and for the head items on the ratings of individual items. If such partition and clustering are done properly, we show that this reduces the recommendation error rates for the tail items, while maintaining reasonable computational performance.},

In this paper, we examine the robustness of a recommendation algorithm based on the data mining technique of association rule mining. Our results show that the Apriori algorithm offers large improvement in stability and robustness compared to k-nearest neighbor and other model-based techniques we have studied. Furthermore, our results show that Apriori can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy to k-nn.},

abstract = {Content-centric social websites, such as discussion forums and blog sites, have flourished during the past several years. These sites often contain overwhelming amounts of information that are also being updated rapidly. To help users locate their interests at such sites (e.g., interesting blogs to read or discussion forums to join), researchers have developed a number of recommendation technologies. However, it is difficult to make effective recommendations for new users (a.k.a. the cold start problem) due to a lack of user information (e.g., preferences and interests). Furthermore, the complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending let alone trusting the recommended results. To tackle the above two challenges, we are building a social map-based recommender system called Pharos. A social map summarizes users' content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. Each community is characterized by the theme of the content being discussed and the key people involved. By discovering, ranking, and displaying the most "popular" latent communities, Pharos creates a visual social map of a website. This enables new users to obtain a quick overview of the site, alleviating the cold start problem. Furthermore, we use the social map as a context to help explain Pharos-recommended content and people. Users can also interactively explore the social map to locate their interested content or people that are not being explicitly recommended, compensating for the imperfection in the recommendation algorithms. We have deployed Pharos within our company and our preliminary evaluation shows the usefulness of Pharos.},

We propose to replace this step with the use of a trust metric, an algorithm able to propagate trust over the trust network and to estimate a trust weight that can be used in place of the similarity weight. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings.},
