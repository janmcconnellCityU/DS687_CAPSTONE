abstract = {Predicting the popularity of online content on social platforms is an important task for both researchers and practitioners. Previous methods mainly leverage demographics, temporal and structural patterns of early adopters for popularity prediction. However, most existing methods are less effective to precisely capture the cascading effect in information diffusion, in which early adopters try to activate potential users along the underlying network. In this paper, we consider the problem of network-aware popularity prediction, leveraging both early adopters and social networks for popularity prediction. We propose to capture the cascading effect explicitly, modeling the activation state of a target user given the activation state and influence of his/her neighbors. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel method, namely CoupledGNN, which uses two coupled graph neural networks to capture the interplay between node activation states and the spread of influence. By stacking graph neural network layers, our proposed method naturally captures the cascading effect along the network in a successive manner. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world Sina Weibo datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for popularity prediction.},

abstract = {Understanding and predicting the popularity of online items is an important open problem in social media analysis. Most of the recent work on popularity prediction is either based on learning a variety of features from full network data or using generative processes to model the event time data. We identify two gaps in the current state of the art prediction models. The first is the unexplored connection and comparison between the two aforementioned approaches. In our work, we bridge gap between feature-driven and generative models by modelling social cascade with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process. We then learn a predictive layer on top for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. Secondly, the existing methods typically focus on a single source of external influence, whereas for many types of online content such as YouTube videos or news articles, attention is driven by multiple heterogeneous sources simultaneously - e.g. microblogs or traditional media coverage. We propose a recurrent neural network based model for asynchronous streams that connects multiple streams of different granularity via joint inference. We further design two new measures, one to explain the viral potential of videos, the other to uncover latent influences including seasonal trends. This work provides accurate and explainable popularity predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers to allocate resources for promotion campaigns.},

abstract = {We describe LASER, a scalable response prediction platform currently used as part of a social network advertising system. LASER enables the familiar logistic regression model to be applied to very large scale response prediction problems, including ones beyond advertising. Though the underlying model is well understood, we apply a whole-system approach to address model accuracy, scalability, explore-exploit, and real-time inference. To facilitate training with both large numbers of training examples and high dimensional features on commodity clustered hardware, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Because online advertising applications are much less static than classical presentations of response prediction, LASER employs a number of techniques that allows it to adapt in real time. LASER models can be divided into components with different re-training frequencies, allowing us to learn from changes in ad campaign performance frequently without incurring the cost of retraining larger, more stable sections of the model. Thompson sampling during online inference further helps by efficiently balancing exploration of new ads with exploitation of long running ones. To enable predictions made with the most recent feature data, we employ a range of techniques, including extensive caching and lazy evaluation, to permit real time, low latency scoring. LASER models are defined using a configuration language that ties together the training, validation, and inference pieces and permits even non-programming analysts to experiment with different model structures without modifications to code or interruptions to running servers. Finally, we show via extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests that this system provides significant benefits to prediction accuracy, gains in revenue and CTR, and reductions in system latency.},

This makes explicitly combating selection biases an essential problem in training recommender systems. Most previous studies assume no unbiased data available for training. We relax this assumption and assume that a small subset of training data is unbiased. Then, we propose a novel objective that utilizes the unbiased data to adaptively assign propensity weights to biased training ratings. This objective, combined with unbiased performance estimators, alleviates the effects of selection biases on the training of recommender systems. To optimize the objective, we propose an efficient algorithm that minimizes the variance of propensity estimates for better generalized recommender systems. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm the advantages of our approach in significantly reducing both the error of rating prediction and the variance of propensity estimation.},

abstract = {Recommendation Systems (RS) are often plagued by popularity bias. When training a recommendation model on a typically long-tailed dataset, the model tends to not only inherit this bias but often exacerbate it, resulting in over-representation of popular items in the recommendation lists. This study conducts comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses to expose the root causes of this phenomenon, yielding two core insights: 1) Item popularity is memorized in the principal spectrum of the score matrix predicted by the recommendation model; 2) The dimension reduction phenomenon amplifies the relative prominence of the principal spectrum, thereby intensifying the popularity bias. Building on these insights, we propose a novel debiasing strategy that leverages a spectral norm regularizer to penalize the magnitude of the principal singular value. We have developed an efficient algorithm to expedite the calculation of the spectral norm by exploiting the spectral property of the score matrix. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets and three testing paradigms have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method.},

Existing works mainly focus on exploring effective features for prediction, while ignoring the underlying arrival process of retweets. Also, the effect of user activity variation on the retweeting dynamics in the early stages has been neglected. In this paper, we propose an extended reinforced Poisson process model with time mapping process to model the retweeting dynamics and predict the future popularity. The proposed model explicitly characterizes the process through which a message gain its retweets, by capturing a power-law temporal relaxation function corresponding to the aging in the ability of the message to attract new retweets and an exponential reinforcement mechanism characterizing the "richer-get-richer" phenomenon. Further, we introduce the notation of weibo time and integrate a time mapping process into the proposed model to eliminate the effect of user activity variation. Extensive experiments on two Weibo datasets, with 10K and 18K messages respectively, well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in popularity prediction.},

abstract = {User interactions with recommender systems (RSs) are affected by user selection bias, e.g., users are more likely to rate popular items (popularity bias) or items that they expect to enjoy beforehand (positivity bias). Methods exist for mitigating the effects of selection bias in user ratings on the evaluation and optimization of RSs. However, these methods treat selection bias as static, despite the fact that the popularity of an item may change drastically over time and the fact that user preferences may also change over time.We focus on the age of an item and its effect on selection bias and user preferences. Our experimental analysis reveals that the rating behavior of users on the MovieLens dataset is better captured by methods that consider effects from the age of item on bias and preferences. We theoretically show that in a dynamic scenario in which both the selection bias and user preferences are dynamic, existing debiasing methods are no longer unbiased. To address this limitation, we introduce DebiAsing in the dyNamiC scEnaRio (DANCER), a novel debiasing method that extends the inverse propensity scoring debiasing method to account for dynamic selection bias and user preferences. Our experimental results indicate that DANCER improves rating prediction performance compared to debiasing methods that incorrectly assume that selection bias is static in a dynamic scenario. To the best of our knowledge, DANCER is the first debiasing method that accounts for dynamic selection bias and user preferences in RSs.},

abstract = {User engagement prediction plays a critical role in designing interaction strategies to grow user engagement and increase revenue in online social platforms. Through the in-depth analysis of the real-world data from the world's largest professional social platforms, i.e., LinkedIn, we find that users expose diverse engagement patterns, and a major reason for the differences in user engagement patterns is that users have different intents. That is, people have different intents when using LinkedIn, e.g., applying for jobs, building connections, or checking notifications, which shows quite different engagement patterns. Meanwhile, user intents and the corresponding engagement patterns may change over time. Although such pattern differences and dynamics are essential for user engagement prediction, differentiating user engagement patterns based on user dynamic intents for better user engagement forecasting has not received enough attention in previous works. In this paper, we proposed a Dynamic Intent Guided Meta Network (DIGMN), which can explicitly model user intent varying with time and perform differentiated user engagement forecasting. Specifically, we derive some interpretable basic user intents as prior knowledge from data mining and introduce prior intents to explicitly model dynamic user intent. Furthermore, based on the dynamic user intent representations, we propose a meta-predictor to perform differentiated user engagement forecasting. Through a comprehensive evaluation of LinkedIn anonymous user data, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly, i.e., 2.96% and 3.48% absolute error reduction, on coarse-grained and fine-grained user engagement prediction tasks, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

Prior research approaches these biases as isolated and standalone issues, ignoring their interconnected nature and developing separate methods, thereby compromising the specialized debiasing efforts. Thus, we introduce a boosting-based framework designed to alleviate a broad spectrum of biases. This framework employs a series of sub-models, each tailored for different user and item subgroups. Theoretically, our model ensures an exponentially decreasing upper bound on the training loss across all user and item types with increasing boosting iterations.

In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.},

abstract = {In sequential recommendation (SR), neural models have been actively explored due to their remarkable performance, but they suffer from inefficiency inherent to their complexity. Linear SR models exhibit high efficiency and achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to neural models. However, they solely deal with the sequential order of items (i.e., sequential information) and overlook the actual timestamp (i.e., temporal information). It is limited to effectively capturing various user preference drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose a novel linear SR model, named TemporAl LinEar item-item model (TALE), incorporating temporal information while preserving training/inference efficiency. It consists of three key components. (i) Single-target augmentation concentrates on a single target item, enabling us to learn the temporal correlation for the target item. (ii) Time interval-aware weighting utilizes the actual timestamp to discern the item correlation depending on time intervals. (iii) Trend-aware normalization reflects the dynamic shift of item popularity over time. Our empirical studies show that TALE outperforms ten competing SR models by up to 18.71% gains across five benchmark datasets. It also exhibits remarkable effectiveness for evaluating long-tail items by up to 30.45% gains. The source code is available at https://github.com/psm1206/TALE.},

However, existing work mainly focuses on modeling popularity using a single metric such as the total number of likes or shares. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LSTM, a memory-based deep recurrent network that learns to recursively predict the entire diffusion path of an image through a social network. By combining user social features and image features, and encoding the diffusion path taken thus far with an explicit memory cell, our model predicts the diffusion path of an image more accurately compared to alternate baselines that either encode only image or social features, or lack memory. By mapping individual users to user prototypes, our model can generalize to new users not seen during training. Finally, we demonstrate our model»s capability of generating diffusion trees, and show that the generated trees closely resemble ground-truth trees.},

abstract = {As Recommender Systems (RS) influence more and more people in their daily life, the issue of fairness in recommendation is becoming more and more important. Most of the prior approaches to fairness-aware recommendation have been situated in a static or one-shot setting, where the protected groups of items are fixed, and the model provides a one-time fairness solution based on fairness-constrained optimization. This fails to consider the dynamic nature of the recommender systems, where attributes such as item popularity may change over time due to the recommendation policy and user engagement. For example, products that were once popular may become no longer popular, and vice versa. As a result, the system that aims to maintain long-term fairness on the item exposure in different popularity groups must accommodate this change in a timely fashion.Novel to this work, we explore the problem of long-term fairness in recommendation and accomplish the problem through dynamic fairness learning. We focus on the fairness of exposure of items in different groups, while the division of the groups is based on item popularity, which dynamically changes over time in the recommendation process. We tackle this problem by proposing a fairness-constrained reinforcement learning algorithm for recommendation, which models the recommendation problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), so that the model can dynamically adjust its recommendation policy to make sure the fairness requirement is always satisfied when the environment changes. Experiments on several real-world datasets verify our framework's superiority in terms of recommendation performance, short-term fairness, and long-term fairness.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing conversational recommender systems (CRS) by effectively indexing item content, understanding complex conversational contexts, and generating relevant item titles. However, the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which outputs item titles as a long sequence of subtokens, hinders the ability to efficiently obtain and control recommendations across the entire item set. This challenge in calculating probabilities over all items limits LLMs' potential, such as (1) limiting control over recommendation popularities and (2) preventing the synergy of marrying LLMs and traditional recommender systems (RecSys).To address this challenge, we propose the Reindex-Then-Adapt (RTA) framework. It consists of two steps: (1) Reindex: a lightweight network learns to condense multi-token item titles into single tokens within the LLM and distills LLM-generated recommendations as ranked lists. This bypasses the autoregressive nature of LLMs while trying to preserve their CRS abilities; (2) Adapt: LLMs after reindexing enable efficient adjustment of probability distributions over single-token titles, further enhanced through RecSys integration. RTA bridges the strengths of LLMs and RecSys, enabling understanding of complex queries as LLMs do, while efficiently controlling recommended item distributions as in traditional RecSys. We show the effectiveness of our RTA over base LLMs across three CRS datasets with negligible additional parameters.},

abstract = {Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output of scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: "Will this paper increase my h-index?" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the topic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5% potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more effectively leverage their position of "standing on the shoulders of giants."},

abstract = {Mobile advertising has recently seen dramatic growth, fueled by the global proliferation of mobile phones and devices. The task of predicting ad response is thus crucial for maximizing business revenue. However, ad response data change dynamically over time, and are subject to cold-start situations in which limited history hinders reliable prediction. There is also a need for a robust regression estimation for high prediction accuracy, and good ranking to distinguish the impacts of different ads. To this end, we develop a Hierarchical Importance-aware Factorization Machine (HIFM), which provides an effective generic latent factor framework that incorporates importance weights and hierarchical learning. Comprehensive empirical studies on a real-world mobile advertising dataset show that HIFM outperforms the contemporary temporal latent factor models. The results also demonstrate the efficacy of the HIFM's importance-aware and hierarchical learning in improving the overall prediction and prediction in cold-start scenarios, respectively.},

abstract = {In a collaborative-filtering recommendation scenario, biases in the data will likely propagate in the learned recommendations. In this paper we focus on the so-called mainstream bias: the tendency of a recommender system to provide better recommendations to users who have a mainstream taste, as opposed to non-mainstream users. We propose NAECF, a conceptually simple but effective idea to address this bias. The idea consists of adding an autoencoder (AE) layer when learning user and item representations with text-based Convolutional Neural Networks. The AEs, one for the users and one for the items, serve as adversaries to the process of minimizing the rating prediction error when learning how to recommend. They enforce that the specific unique properties of all users and items are sufficiently well incorporated and preserved in the learned representations. These representations, extracted as the bottlenecks of the corresponding AEs, are expected to be less biased towards mainstream users, and to provide more balanced recommendation utility across all users. Our experimental results confirm these expectations, significantly improving the recommendations for non-mainstream users while maintaining the recommendation quality for mainstream users. Our results emphasize the importance of deploying extensive content-based features, such as online reviews, in order to better represent users and items to maximize the de-biasing effect.},

abstract = {Accurately predicting user preferences/ratings over items are crucial for many Internet applications, e.g., recommender systems, online advertising. In current main-stream algorithms regarding the rating prediction problem, discrete rating scores are often viewed as either numerical values or(nominal) categorical labels. Practically, viewing user rating scores as numerical values or categorical labels cannot precisely reflect the exact degree of user preferences. It is expected that for each user, the quantitative distance/scale between any pair of adjacent rating scores could be different.  In this paper, we propose a new ordinal regression approach. We view ordered preference scores in an additive way, where we are able to model users» internal rating patterns. Specifically, we model and learn the quantitative distances/scales between any pair of adjacent rating scores. In this way, we can generate a mapping from users» assigned discrete rating scores to the exact magnitude/degree of user preferences for items. In the application of rating prediction, we combine our newly proposed ordinal regression method with matrix factorization, forming a new ordinal matrix factorization method. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing ordinal methods, as well as other popular collaborative filtering methods in terms of the rating prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Online reviews allow consumers to provide detailed feedback on various aspects of items. Existing methods utilize these aspects to model users' fine-grained preferences for specific item features through graph neural networks. We argue that the performance of items on different aspects is important for making precise recommendations, which has not been taken into account by existing approaches, due to lack of data. In this paper, we propose an aspect performance-aware hypergraph neural network (APH) for the review-based recommendation, which learns the performance of items from the conflicting sentiment polarity of user reviews. Specifically, APH comprehensively models the relationships among users, items, aspects, and sentiment polarity by systematically constructing an aspect hypergraph based on user reviews. In addition, APH aggregates aspects representing users and items by employing an aspect performance-aware hypergraph aggregation method. It aggregates the sentiment polarities from multiple users by jointly considering user preferences and the semantics of their sentiments, determining the weights of sentiment polarities to infer the performance of items on various aspects. Such performances are then used as weights to aggregate neighboring aspects. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that APH improves MSE, Precision@5, and Recall@5 by an average of 2.30%, 4.89%, and 1.60% over the best baseline.

That is, conditioned on user preferences that a user likes both items, the more popular item is more likely to be recommended (or ranked higher) to the user than the less popular one. This type of bias is harmful, exerting negative effects on the engagement of both users and item providers. Thus, we conduct a three-part study: (i) By a comprehensive empirical study, we identify the existence of the popularity-opportunity bias in fundamental matrix factorization models on four datasets; (ii) coupled with this empirical study, our theoretical study shows that matrix factorization models inherently produce the bias; and (iii) we demonstrate the potential of alleviating this bias by both in-processing and post-processing algorithms. Extensive experiments on four datasets show the effective debiasing performance of these proposed methods compared with baselines designed for conventional popularity bias.},

abstract = {In recent years, the field of recommendation systems has witnessed significant advancements, with explainable recommendation systems gaining prominence as a crucial area of research. These systems aim to enhance user experience by providing transparent and compelling recommendations, accompanied by explanations. However, a persistent challenge lies in addressing biases that can influence the recommendations and explanations offered by these systems. Such biases often stem from a tendency to favor popular items and generate explanations that highlight their common attributes, thereby deviating from the objective of delivering personalized recommendations and explanations. While existing debiasing methods have been applied in explainable recommendation systems, they often overlook the model-generated explanations in tackling biases. Consequently, biases in model-generated explanations may persist, potentially compromising system performance and user satisfaction.To address biases in both model-generated explanations and recommended items, we discern the impact of model-generated explanations in recommendation through a formulated causal graph. Inspired by this causal perspective, we propose a novel approach termed Causal Explainable Recommendation System (CERS), which incorporates model-generated explanations into the debiasing process and enacts causal interventions based on user feedback on the explanations. By utilizing model-generated explanations as intermediaries between user-item interactions and recommendation results, we adeptly mitigate the biases via targeted causal interventions. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of CERS in reducing popularity bias while simultaneously improving recommendation performance, leading to more personalized and tailored recommendations. Human evaluation further affirms that CERS generates explanations tailored to individual users, thereby enhancing the persuasiveness of the system.},

However, they are also limited in their assumption of static or sequential modeling of relational data as they do not account for evolving users' preference over time as well as changes in the underlying factors that drive the change in user-item relationship over time. We address these limitations by proposing a Neural network based Tensor Factorization (NTF) model for predictive tasks on dynamic relational data. The NTF model generalizes conventional tensor factorization from two perspectives: First, it leverages the long short-term memory architecture to characterize the multi-dimensional temporal interactions on relational data. Second, it incorporates the multi-layer perceptron structure for learning the non-linearities between different latent factors. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvement in both the rating prediction and link prediction tasks on various dynamic relational data by our NTF model over both neural network based factorization models and other traditional methods.},

abstract = {Recent studies on pre-trained vision/language models have demonstrated the practical benefit of a new, promising solution-building paradigm in AI where models can be pre-trained on broad data describing a generic task space and then adapted successfully to solve a wide range of downstream tasks, even when training data is severely limited (e.g., in zero- or few-shot learning scenarios). Inspired by such progress, we investigate in this paper the possibilities and challenges of adapting such a paradigm to the context of recommender systems, which is less investigated from the perspective of pre-trained model. In particular, we propose to develop a generic recommender that captures universal interaction patterns by training on generic user-item interaction data extracted from different domains, which can then be fast adapted to improve few-shot learning performance in unseen new domains (with limited data).  However, unlike vision/language data which share strong conformity in the semantic space, universal patterns underlying recommendation data collected across different domains (e.g., different countries or different E-commerce platforms) are often occluded by both in-domain and cross-domain biases implicitly imposed by the cultural differences in their user and item bases, as well as their uses of different e-commerce platforms. As shown in our experiments, such heterogeneous biases in the data tend to hinder the effectiveness of the pre-trained model. To address this challenge, we further introduce and formalize a causal debiasing perspective, which is substantiated via a hierarchical Bayesian deep learning model, named model. Our empirical studies on real-world data show that the proposed model could significantly improve the recommendation performance in zero- and few-shot learning settings under both cross-market and cross-platform scenarios.},

However, current mainstream solutions loosely connect the learning of explanation with the learning of recommendation: for example, they are often separately modeled as rating prediction and content generation tasks. In this work, we propose to strengthen their connection by enforcing the idea of sentiment alignment between a recommendation and its corresponding explanation. At training time, the two learning tasks are joined by a latent sentiment vector, which is encoded by the recommendation module and used to make word choices for explanation generation. At both training and inference time, the explanation module is required to generate explanation text that matches sentiment predicted by the recommendation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate our solution outperforms a rich set of baselines in both recommendation and explanation tasks, especially on the improved quality of its generated explanations. More importantly, our user studies confirm our generated explanations help users better recognize the differences between recommended items and understand why an item is recommended.},

In this work, we propose to build E-commerce product recommender systems based on fundamental economic notions. We first proposed an incentive compatible method that can effectively elicit consumer's willingness-to-pay in a typical E-commerce setting and in a further step, we formalize the recommendation problem as maximizing total surplus. We validated the proposed WTP elicitation algorithm through crowd sourcing and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach can achieve higher seller profit by personalizing promotion. We also proposed a total surplus maximization (TSM) based recommendation framework. We specified TSM by three of the most representative settings - e-commerce where the product quantity can be viewed as infinity, P2P lending where the resource is bounded and freelancer marketing where the resource (job) can be assigned to one freelancer. The experimental results of the corresponding datasets shows that TSM exceeds existing approach in terms of total surplus.},

This thesis aims to develop a rich set of mathematical equivalences and extensions, and use them to ask and answer questions in social media and beyond.

abstract = {The collective attention on online items such as web pages, search terms, and videos reflects trends that are of social, cultural, and economic interest. Moreover, attention trends of different items exhibit mutual influence via mechanisms such as hyperlinks or recommendations. Many visualisation tools exist for time series, network evolution, or network influence; however, few systems connect all three. In this work, we present AttentionFlow, a new system to visualise networks of time series and the dynamic influence they have on one another. Centred around an ego node, our system simultaneously presents the time series on each node using two visual encodings: a tree ring for an overview and a line chart for details. AttentionFlow supports interactions such as overlaying time series of influence, and filtering neighbours by time or flux. We demonstrate AttentionFlow using two real-world datasets, VevoMusic and WikiTraffic. We show that attention spikes in songs can be explained by external events such as major awards, or changes in the network such as the release of a new song. Separate case studies also demonstrate how an artist's influence changes over their career, and that correlated Wikipedia traffic is driven by cultural interests. More broadly, AttentionFlow can be generalised to visualise networks of time series on physical infrastructures such as road networks, or natural phenomena such as weather and geological measurements.},

abstract = {Pairwise algorithms are popular for learning recommender systems from implicit feedback. For each user, or more generally context, they try to discriminate between a small set of selected items and the large set of remaining (irrelevant) items. Learning is typically based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with uniformly drawn pairs. In this work, we show that convergence of such SGD learning algorithms slows down considerably if the item popularity has a tailed distribution. We propose a non-uniform item sampler to overcome this problem. The proposed sampler is context-dependent and oversamples informative pairs to speed up convergence. An efficient implementation with constant amortized runtime costs is developed. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed learning algorithm can be applied to a large class of recommender models. The properties of the new learning algorithm are studied empirically on two real-world recommender system problems. The experiments indicate that the proposed adaptive sampler improves the state-of-the art learning algorithm largely in convergence without negative effects on prediction quality or iteration runtime.},

abstract = {A recommendation is called explainable if it not only predicts a numerical rating for an item, but also generates explanations for users' preferences. Most existing methods for explainable recommendation apply topic models to analyze user reviews to provide descriptions along with the recommendations they produce. So far, such methods have neglected user opinions and influences from social relations as a source of information for recommendations, even though these are known to improve the rating prediction.In this paper, we propose a latent variable model, called social collaborative viewpoint regression (sCVR), for predicting item ratings based on user opinions and social relations. To this end, we use so-called viewpoints, represented as tuples of a concept, topic, and a sentiment label from both user reviews and trusted social relations. In addition, such viewpoints can be used as explanations. We apply a Gibbs EM sampler to infer posterior distributions of sCVR. Experiments conducted on three large benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method for predicting item ratings and for generating explanations.},

However, trust, as a social concept, inherently has many facets indicating multiple and heterogeneous trust relationships between users. Due to the presence of a large trust network for an online user, it is necessary to discern multi-faceted trust as there are naturally experts of different types. Our study in product review sites reveals that people place trust differently to different people. Since the widely used adjacency matrix cannot capture multi-faceted trust relationships between users, we propose a novel approach by incorporating these relationships into traditional rating prediction algorithms to reliably estimate their strengths. Our work results in interesting findings such as heterogeneous pairs of reciprocal links. Experimental results on real-world data from Epinions and Ciao show that our work of discerning multi-faceted trust can be applied to improve the performance of tasks such as rating prediction, facet-sensitive ranking, and status theory.},

abstract = {Due to the growing privacy concerns, decentralization emerges rapidly in personalized services, especially recommendation. Also, recent studies have shown that centralized models are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, compromising their integrity. In the context of recommender systems, a typical goal of such poisoning attacks is to promote the adversary's target items by interfering with the training dataset and/or process. Hence, a common practice is to subsume recommender systems under the decentralized federated learning paradigm, which enables all user devices to collaboratively learn a global recommender while retaining all the sensitive data locally. Without exposing the full knowledge of the recommender and entire dataset to end-users, such federated recommendation is widely regarded 'safe' towards poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to backdooring federated recommender systems for targeted item promotion. The core tactic is to take advantage of the inherent popularity bias that commonly exists in data-driven recommenders. As popular items are more likely to appear in the recommendation list, our innovatively designed attack model enables the target item to have the characteristics of popular items in the embedding space. Then, by uploading carefully crafted gradients via a small number of malicious users during the model update, we can effectively increase the exposure rate of a target (unpopular) item in the resulted federated recommender. Evaluations on two real-world datasets show that 1) our attack model significantly boosts the exposure rate of the target item in a stealthy way, without harming the accuracy of the poisoned recommender; and 2) existing defenses are not effective enough, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local model poisoning attacks to federated recommender systems.},

abstract = {In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in Collaborative Filtering (CF), one of the most popular methods in recommender systems. However, most existing works focus on designing an individual model architecture given a specific scenario, without studying the influences of different design dimensions. Thus, it remains a challenging problem to quickly obtain a top-performing model in a new recommendation scenario. To address the problem, in this work, we make the first attempt to profile the design space of GNN-based CF methods to enrich the understanding of different design dimensions as well as provide a novel paradigm of model design. Specifically, a unified framework of GNN-based CF is proposed, on top of which a design space is developed and evaluated by extensive experiments. Interesting findings on the impacts of different design dimensions on recommendation performance are obtained. Guided by the empirical findings, we further prune the design space to obtain a compact one containing a higher concentration of top-performing models. Empirical studies demonstrate its high quality and strong generalization ability.},

abstract = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to tackle the user cold-start problem, which aims to make recommendations for users in the target domain by transferring the user preference derived from the source domain. Traditional CDR studies follow the embedding and mapping (EMCDR) paradigm, which transfers user representations from the source to target domain by learning a user-shared mapping function, neglecting the user-specific preference. Recent CDR studies attempt to learn user-specific mapping functions in meta-learning paradigm, which regards each user's CDR as an individual task, but neglects the preference correlations among users, limiting the beneficial information for user representations. Moreover, both of the paradigms neglect the explicit user-item interactions from both domains during the mapping process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel CDR framework with neural process (NP), termed as CDRNP. Particularly, it develops the meta-learning paradigm to leverage user-specific preference, and further introduces a stochastic process by NP to capture the preference correlations among the overlapping and cold-start users, thus generating more powerful mapping functions by mapping the user-specific preference and common preference correlations to a predictive probability distribution. In addition, we also introduce a preference remainer to enhance the common preference from the overlapping users, and finally devises an adaptive conditional decoder with preference modulation to make prediction for cold-start users with items in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRNP outperforms previous SOTA methods in three real-world CDR scenarios.},

abstract = {Aspect-based opinion mining from online reviews has attracted a lot of attention recently. Given a set of reviews, the main task of aspect-based opinion mining is to extract major aspects of the items and to infer the latent aspect ratings from each review. However, users may have different preferences which might lead to different opinions on the same aspect of an item. Even if fine-grained aspect rating analysis is provided for each review, it is still difficult for a user to judge whether a specific aspect of an item meets his own expectation. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating personalized sentiment polarities on different aspects of the items. We propose a unified probabilistic model called Factorized Latent Aspect ModEl (FLAME), which combines the advantages of collaborative filtering and aspect based opinion mining. FLAME learns users' personalized preferences on different aspects from their past reviews, and predicts users' aspect ratings on new items by collective intelligence. Experiments on two online review datasets show that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the tasks of aspect identification and aspect rating prediction.},

abstract = {With rapidly growing amount of data available on the web, it becomes increasingly likely to obtain data from different perspectives for multi-view learning. Some successive examples of web applications include recommendation and target advertising. Specifically, to predict whether a user will click an ad in a query context, there are available features extracted from user profile, ad information and query description, and each of them can only capture part of the task signals from a particular aspect/view. Different views provide complementary information to learn a practical model for these applications. Therefore, an effective integration of the multi-view information is critical to facilitate the learning performance.In this paper, we propose a general predictor, named multi-view machines (MVMs), that can effectively explore the full-order interactions between features from multiple views. A joint factorization is applied for the interaction parameters which makes parameter estimation more accurate under sparsity and renders the model with the capacity to avoid overfitting. Moreover, MVMs can work in conjunction with different loss functions for a variety of machine learning tasks. The advantages of MVMs are illustrated through comparison with other methods for multi-view prediction, including support vector machines (SVMs), support tensor machines (STMs) and factorization machines (FMs).A stochastic gradient descent method and a distributed implementation on Spark are presented to learn the MVM model. Through empirical studies on two real-world web application datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMs on modeling feature interactions in multi-view data. A 3.51% accuracy improvement is shown on MVMs over FMs for the problem of movie rating prediction, and 0.57% for ad click prediction.},

abstract = {The issue of fairness in recommendation is becoming increasingly essential as Recommender Systems (RS) touch and influence more and more people in their daily lives. In fairness-aware recommendation, most of the existing algorithmic approaches mainly aim at solving a constrained optimization problem by imposing a constraint on the level of fairness while optimizing the main recommendation objective, e.g., click through rate (CTR). While this alleviates the impact of unfair recommendations, the expected return of an approach may significantly compromise the recommendation accuracy due to the inherent trade-off between fairness and utility. This motivates us to deal with these conflicting objectives and explore the optimal trade-off between them in recommendation. One conspicuous approach is to seek aPareto efficient/optimal solution to guarantee optimal compromises between utility and fairness. Moreover, considering the needs of real-world e-commerce platforms, it would be more desirable if we can generalize the wholePareto Frontier, so that the decision-makers can specify any preference of one objective over another based on their current business needs. Therefore, in this work, we propose a fairness-aware recommendation framework usingmulti-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), called MoFIR (pronounced "more fair ''), which is able to learn a single parametric representation for optimal recommendation policies over the space of all possible preferences. Specially, we modify traditional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) by introducingconditioned network (CN) into it, which conditions the networks directly on these preferences and outputs Q-value-vectors. Experiments on several real-world recommendation datasets verify the superiority of our framework on both fairness metrics and recommendation measures when compared with all other baselines. We also extract the approximate Pareto Frontier on real-world datasets generated by MoFIR and compare to state-of-the-art fairness methods.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a number of studies in order to move the field of recommender systems beyond the traditional paradigm and the classical perspective of rating prediction accuracy. We contribute to existing helpful but less explored recommendation strategies and propose new approaches targeting to more useful recommendations for both users and businesses. Working toward this direction, we discuss the studies we have conducted so far and present our future research plans. The overall goal of this research program is to expand our focus from even more accurate rating predictions toward a more holistic experience for the users, by providing them with non-obvious but high quality recommendations and avoiding the over-specialization and concentration bias problems. In particular, we propose a new probabilistic neighborhood-based method as an improvement of the standard $k$-nearest neighbors approach, alleviating some of the most common problems of collaborative filtering recommender systems, based on classical metrics of dispersion and diversity as well as some newly proposed metrics. Furthermore, we propose a concept of unexpectedness in recommender systems and operationalize it by suggesting various mechanisms for specifying the expectations of the users and proposing a recommendation method for providing the users with unexpected but high quality personalized recommendations that fairly match their interests. Besides, in order to generate utility-based recommendations for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that better serve the educational needs of students, we study the satisfaction of users with online courses vis-a-vis student retention. Finally, we summarize the conclusions of the conducted studies, discuss the limitations of our work and also outline the managerial implications of the proposed stream of research.},

abstract = {Negative sampling plays a crucial role for cross-domain recommendation as it provides contrastive signals to learn user preference. Existing methods usually select items with high predicted scores or popularity as hard negative samples to improve model training. However, such methods suffer from choosing false negative samples since items with high predicted scores or popularity could also indicate potential positive user preference. Although several studies devoted to discovering true negative samples, few of them leverage user cross-domain behaviors to alleviate the false negative issue. How to effectively mine and utilize hard negative samples to improve cross-domain recommendation remains an open question.In this work, we propose exploration and exploitation of hard negative samples (EXHANS) for cross-domain sequential recommendation. For better exploration, we utilize the user preference from the source domain to guide negative sampling in the target domain. The key idea is that compared with hard negative samples, false negative samples have higher probability to be consistent with the user preference in both domains. Besides, we propose adaptive popularity-based score correction to account for users' different tastes of popular items. The idea is that for users who favor popular items, such items are more likely to be false negatives rather than hard negatives. For better exploitation, we design a replay buffer to cache the obtained negative samples and further propose a curriculum learning framework to balance exploration and exploitation of hard negative samples. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art negative sampling methods for cross-domain sequential recommendation, which verify the effectiveness of EXHANS.},

In this work, we characterize the growth patterns of video popularity on the currently most popular video sharing application, namely YouTube. Using newly provided data by the application, we analyze how the popularity of individual videos evolves since the video's upload time. Moreover, addressing a key aspect that has been mostly overlooked by previous work, we characterize the types of the referrers that most often attracted users to each video, aiming at shedding some light into the mechanisms (e.g., searching or external linking) that often drive users towards a video, and thus contribute to popularity growth. Our analyses are performed separately for three video datasets, namely, videos that appear in the YouTube top lists, videos removed from the system due to copyright violation, and videos selected according to random queries submitted to YouTube's search engine. Our results show that popularity growth patterns depend on the video dataset. In particular, copyright protected videos tend to get most of their views much earlier in their lifetimes, often exhibiting a popularity growth characterized by a viral epidemic-like propagation process. In contrast, videos in the top lists tend to experience sudden significant bursts of popularity. We also show that not only search but also other YouTube internal mechanisms play important roles to attract users to videos in all three datasets.},

However, several recent papers have pointed out critical issues with the evaluation process in recommender systems. Likewise, this paper takes an in-depth look at a fundamental but often neglected aspect of the evaluation procedure, i.e. the datasets themselves. To do so, we adopt a systematic and comprehensive approach to understand the datasets used for implicit feedback based top-K recommendation. We start by examining recent papers from top-tier conferences to find out how different datasets have been utilised thus far. Next, we look at the characteristics of these datasets to understand their similarities and differences. Finally, we conduct an empirical study to determine whether the choice of datasets used for evaluation can influence the observations and/or conclusions obtained. Our findings suggest that greater attention needs to be paid to the selection process of datasets used for evaluating recommender systems in order to improve the robustness of the obtained results.},

abstract = {Online content exhibits rich temporal dynamics, and diverse realtime user generated content further intensifies this process. However, temporal patterns by which online content grows and fades over time, and by which different pieces of content compete for attention remain largely unexplored.We study temporal patterns associated with online content and how the content's popularity grows and fades over time. The attention that content receives on the Web varies depending on many factors and occurs on very different time scales and at different resolutions. In order to uncover the temporal dynamics of online content we formulate a time series clustering problem using a similarity metric that is invariant to scaling and shifting. We develop the K-Spectral Centroid (K-SC) clustering algorithm that effectively finds cluster centroids with our similarity measure. By applying an adaptive wavelet-based incremental approach to clustering, we scale K-SC to large data sets.We demonstrate our approach on two massive datasets: a set of 580 million Tweets, and a set of 170 million blog posts and news media articles. We find that K-SC outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm in finding distinct shapes of time series. Our analysis shows that there are six main temporal shapes of attention of online content. We also present a simple model that reliably predicts the shape of attention by using information about only a small number of participants. Our analyses offer insight into common temporal patterns of the content on theWeb and broaden the understanding of the dynamics of human attention.},

abstract = {As a promising solution for model compression, knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied in recommender systems (RS) to reduce inference latency. Traditional solutions first train a full teacher model from the training data, and then transfer its knowledge (iesoft labels ) to supervise the learning of a compact student model. However, we find such a standard distillation paradigm would incur serious bias issue --- popular items are more heavily recommended after the distillation. This effect prevents the student model from making accurate and fair recommendations, decreasing the effectiveness of RS.In this work, we identify the origin of the bias in KD --- it roots in the biased soft labels from the teacher, and is further propagated and intensified during the distillation. To rectify this, we propose a new KD method with a stratified distillation strategy. It first partitions items into multiple groups according to their popularity, and then extracts the ranking knowledge within each group to supervise the learning of the student. Our method is simple and teacher-agnostic --- it works on distillation stage without affecting the training of the teacher model. We conduct extensive theoretical and empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposal. We release our code at: https://github.com/chengang95/UnKD.},

abstract = {Early rumor detection is crucial for mitigating the widespread dissemination of misinformation. Existing methods predominantly rely on complete rumor diffusion graphs, which are challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios, complicating early detection efforts. To address this challenge, we propose D2, a two-stage framework for early rumor Detection, integrating cascade Diffusion prediction. This framework aims to enhance early rumor detection by incorporating diffusion prediction capabilities. Specifically, a dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) is developed to jointly model users' social and propagation graphs, enabling accurate prediction of potential diffusion paths using limited observed data within short time windows. The inferred diffusion paths are then integrated with early-stage data, and GNNs are employed for graph classification. However, the varying data distributions across different social media platforms necessitate extensive tuning to optimize GNN architectures. To facilitate the detection of rumor diffusion graphs at the initial stages, a search space is designed across four dimensions- aggregation, merge, readout, and sequence functions-encompassing various GNN architectures. Subsequently, D2 employs an efficient differentiable search algorithm to identify high-performance GNNs within this search space. Experimental results on real social media datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of early rumor detection.},

abstract = {Prediction of popular items in online content sharing systems has recently attracted a lot of attention due to the tremendous need of users and its commercial values. Different from previous works that make prediction by fitting a popularity growth model, we tackle this problem by exploiting the latent conforming and maverick personalities of those who vote to assess the quality of on-line items. We argue that the former personality prompts a user to cast her vote conforming to the majority of the service community while on the contrary the later personality makes her vote different from the community. We thus propose a Conformer-Maverick (CM) model to simulate the voting process and use it to rank top-k potentially popular items based on the early votes they received. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we validate our ideas and find that our proposed CM model achieves better performance than baseline solutions, especially for smaller k.},

Such knowledge is paramount to the effective design of various services including content distribution and advertising. Thus, in this paper we formalize the problem of predicting trends and hits in user generated videos. Also, we describe our research methodology on approaching this problem.

Moreover, we intend on evaluating efficacy of our results not only based on common statistical error metrics, but also on the possible online advertising revenues our predictions can generate.

abstract = {Modern collaborative filtering algorithms seek to provide personalized product recommendations by uncovering patterns in consumer-product interactions. However, these interactions can be biased by how the product is marketed, for example due to the selection of a particular human model in a product image. These correlations may result in the underrepresentation of particular niche markets in the interaction data; for example, a female user who would potentially like motorcycle products may be less likely to interact with them if they are promoted using stereotypically 'male' images.In this paper, we first investigate this correlation between users' interaction feedback and products' marketing images on two real-world e-commerce datasets. We further examine the response of several standard collaborative filtering algorithms to the distribution of consumer-product market segments in the input interaction data, revealing that marketing strategy can be a source of bias for modern recommender systems. In order to protect recommendation performance on underrepresented market segments, we develop a framework to address this potential marketing bias. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the recommendation fairness across different market segments, with a negligible loss (or better) recommendation accuracy.},

abstract = {Predicting click-through rates is crucial in various fields, including online advertising and recommendation systems. The key to improving the performance of CTR prediction lies in learning a robust user representation, particularly by analyzing their historical behaviors. Previous studies usually model behavior sequences through attention-based sequence models or graph-based methods, which usually struggle to explore diverse latent interests or accurately model user behaviors. Moreover, this challenge is exacerbated when users' historical behaviors are sparse, a common issue in real-world business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-Enhanced Interest Network (GEIN) to capture users' latent intents and facilitate the sequential learning of sparse behavior sequences. Specifically, we first construct a hierarchical item-intent heterogeneous graph to enrich the representation of sparse behaviors using diverse information from graphs. Next, we build a user-level behavior interest factor graph to accurately capture user interests. Additionally, a contrastive learning mechanism is incorporated to mitigate the negative robustness impacts caused by sparsity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed GEIN outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing also confirms the superiority of GEIN over competing baselines in a real-world production environment.},

abstract = {When we sequentially recommend top-k items to users, how can we recommend them diversely while maintaining accuracy? Aggregate-level diversity is an important topic in recommender system since it is essential to maximize the potential profit of platforms by exposing a variety of items to users. However, previous studies do not consider the order of users receiving recommendations and assume that all users receive recommendations at once. In reality, users do not simultaneously receive recommendations so the preferences of the latter users are not given during recommending to the former users. In this work, we introduce the problem of sequentially diversified recommendation and propose SAPID, an accurate method to address the problem. SAPID removes the popularity bias from the model through a negative sampling mechanism based on temporal popularities. Then, SAPID collects candidate items to recommend based on the distribution of preference scores. Finally, SAPID decides which items to recommend immediately or later according to their estimated exposure opportunities. Extensive experiments show that SAPID shows the state-of-the-art performance in real-world datasets by achieving up to 61.0% increased diversity with 38.9% higher accuracy compared to the second-best competitor.},

Once established the values of exploration, we investigate the Neural Linear Bandit algorithm as a general framework to introduce exploration into any deep learning based ranking systems. We conduct live experiments on one of the largest short-form video recommendation platforms that serves billions of users to validate the new experiment designs, quantify the long-term values of exploration, and to verify the effectiveness of the adopted neural linear bandit algorithm for exploration.},

While the accuracy of recommender systems is important, many recent research indicated that focusing merely on accuracy not only is insufficient to meet user needs, but also may be harmful. Other characteristics such as novelty, unexpectedness and diversity should also be taken into consideration. Previous work has shown that more the sales of long-tail items could be more beneficial to both customers and some business models. However, the majority of collaborative filtering approaches tends to recommend popular selling items. In this work, we focus on long-tail item promotion and aggregate diversity enhancement, and propose a novel approach which diversifies the results of recommender systems by considering ``recommendations" as resources to be allocated to the items. Our approach increases the quantity and quality of long-tail item recommendations by adding more variation into the recommendation and maintains a certain level of accuracy simultaneously. The experimental results show that this approach can discover more worth-recommending items from Long Tails and improves user experience.},

abstract = {In the world of E-Commerce, the core task is to understand the personalized preference from various kinds of heterogeneous information, such as textual reviews, item images and historical behaviors. In current systems, these heterogeneous information are mainly exploited to generate better item or user representations. For example, in scenario of visual search, the importance of modeling query image has been widely acknowledged. But, these existing solutions focus on improving the representation quality of the query image, overlooking the personalized visual preference of the user. Note that the visual features affect the user's decision significantly, e.g., the user could be more likely to click the items with her preferred design. Hence, it is fruitful to exploit the visual preference to deliver better capacity for personalization. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective target-aware visual preference learning framework (named Tavern) for both item recommendation and search. The proposed Tavern works as an individual and generic model that can be smoothly plugged into different downstream systems. Specifically, for visual preference learning, we utilize the image of the target item to derive the visual preference signals for each historical clicked item. This procedure is modeled as a form of representation disentanglement, where the visual preference signals are extracted by taking off the noisy information irrelevant to visual preference from the shared visual information between the target and historical items. During this process, a novel selective orthogonality disentanglement is proposed to avoid the significant information loss. Then, a GRU network is utilized to aggregate these signals to form the final visual preference representation. Extensive experiments over three large-scale real-world datasets covering visual search, product search and recommendation well demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Tavern against existing technical alternatives. Further ablation study also confirms the validity of each design choice.},

abstract = {Despite deep neural network (DNN)'s impressive prediction performance in various domains, it is well known now that a set of DNN models trained with the same model specification and the exact same training data could produce very different prediction results. People have relied on the state-of-the-art ensemble method to estimate prediction uncertainty. However, ensembles are expensive to train and serve for web-scale traffic systems.In this paper, we seek to advance the understanding of prediction variation estimated by the ensemble method. Through empirical experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets Movielens and Criteo in recommender systems, we observe that prediction variations come from various randomness sources, including training data shuffling, and random initialization. When we add more randomness sources to ensemble members, we see higher prediction variations among these ensemble members, and more accurate mean prediction. Moreover, we propose to infer prediction variation from neuron activation strength and demonstrate its strong prediction power. Our approach provides a simple way for prediction variation estimation, and opens up new opportunities for future work in many interesting areas (e.g., model-based reinforcement learning) without relying on serving expensive ensemble models.},

Recent methods have employed large language models to generate synthetic queries, which serve as proxies for actual user queries. However, they lack control over the content generated, often resulting in incomplete coverage of academic concepts in documents. We introduce Concept Coverage-based Query set Generation (CCQGen) framework, designed to generate a set of queries with comprehensive coverage of the document's concepts. A key distinction of CCQGen is that it adaptively adjusts the generation process based on the previously generated queries. We identify concepts not sufficiently covered by previous queries, and leverage them as conditions for subsequent query generation. This approach guides each new query to complement the previous ones, aiding in a thorough understanding of the document. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCQGen significantly enhances query quality and retrieval performance.},

abstract = {Since the inception of Recommender Systems (RS), the accuracy of the recommendations in terms of relevance has been the golden criterion for evaluating the quality of RS algorithms. However, by focusing on item relevance, one pays a significant price in terms of other important metrics: users get stuck in a "filter bubble" and their array of options is significantly reduced, hence degrading the quality of the user experience and leading to churn. Recommendation, and in particular session-based/sequential recommendation, is a complex task with multiple - and often conflicting objectives - that existing state-of-the-art approaches fail to address. In this work, we take on the aforementioned challenge and introduce Scalarized Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (SMORL) for the RS setting, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that can effectively address multi-objective recommendation tasks. The proposed SMORL agent augments standard recommendation models with additional RL layers that enforce it to simultaneously satisfy three principal objectives: accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. We integrate this framework with four state-of-the-art session-based recommendation models and compare it with a single-objective RL agent that only focuses on accuracy. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets reveal a substantial increase in aggregate diversity, a moderate increase in accuracy, reduced repetitiveness of recommendations, and demonstrate the importance of reinforcing diversity and novelty as complementary objectives.},

The first is a generalized version of stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with arbitrary recovery time distributions; the second is the relationship between the (latent and arbitrary) recovery time distribution, recovery hazard function, and the infection kernel of self-exciting processes; the third includes methods for simulating, fitting, evaluating and predicting the generalized process. On three large Twitter diffusion datasets, we conduct goodness-of-fit tests and holdout log-likelihood evaluation of self-exciting processes with three infection kernels --- exponential, power-law and Tsallis Q-exponential. We show that the modeling performance of the infection kernels varies with respect to the temporal structures of diffusions, and also with respect to user behavior, such as the likelihood of being bots. We further improve the prediction of popularity by combining two models that are identified as complementary by the goodness-of-fit tests.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular method for recommender systems. The principal idea of CF is that users might be interested in items that are favorited by similar users, and most of the existing CF methods measure users' preferences by their behaviours over all the items. However, users might have different interests over different topics, thus might share similar preferences with different groups of users over different sets of items. In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable method CCCF which improves the performance of CF methods via user-item co-clustering. CCCF first clusters users and items into several subgroups, where each subgroup includes a set of like-minded users and a set of items in which these users share their interests. Then, traditional CF methods can be easily applied to each subgroup, and the recommendation results from all the subgroups can be easily aggregated. Compared with previous works, CCCF has several advantages including scalability, flexibility, interpretability and extensibility. Experimental results on four real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of several state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Recommender systems widely use implicit feedback such as click data because of its general availability. Although the presence of clicks signals the users' preference to some extent, the lack of such clicks does not necessarily indicate a negative response from the users, as it is possible that the users were not exposed to the items (positive-unlabeled problem). This leads to a difficulty in predicting the users' preferences from implicit feedback. Previous studies addressed the positive-unlabeled problem by uniformly upweighting the loss for the positive feedback data or estimating the confidence of each data having relevance information via the EM-algorithm. However, these methods failed to address the missing-not-at-random problem in which popular or frequently recommended items are more likely to be clicked than other items even if a user does not have a considerable interest in them. To overcome these limitations, we first define an ideal loss function to be optimized to realize recommendations that maximize the relevance and propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal loss. Subsequently, we analyze the variance of the proposed unbiased estimator and further propose a clipped estimator that includes the unbiased estimator as a special case. We demonstrate that the clipped estimator is expected to improve the performance of the recommender system, by considering the bias-variance trade-off. We conduct semi-synthetic and real-world experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method largely outperforms the baselines. In particular, the proposed method works better for less popular items that are less frequently observed in the training data. The findings indicate that the proposed method can better achieve the objective of recommending items with the highest relevance.},

abstract = {Sequential recommendation (SR) models are typically trained on user-item interactions which are affected by the system exposure bias, leading to the user preference learned from the biased SR model not being fully consistent with the true user preference. Exposure bias refers to the fact that user interactions are dependent upon the partial items exposed to the user. Existing debiasing methods do not make full use of the system exposure data and suffer from sub-optimal recommendation performance and high variance.In this paper, we propose to debias sequential recommenders through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) over system exposure data. The key idea is to utilize DRO to optimize the worst-case error over an uncertainty set to safeguard the model against distributional discrepancy caused by the exposure bias. The main challenge to apply DRO for exposure debiasing in sequential recommendation lies in how to construct the uncertainty set and avoid the overestimation of user preference on biased samples. Moreover, since the test set could also be affected by the exposure bias, how to evaluate the debiasing effect is also an open question. To this end, we first introduce an exposure simulator trained upon the system exposure data to calculate the exposure distribution, which is then regarded as the nominal distribution to construct the uncertainty set of DRO. Then, we introduce a penalty to items with high exposure probability to avoid the overestimation of user preference for biased samples. Finally, we design a debiased self-normalized inverse propensity score (SNIPS) evaluator for evaluating the debiasing effect on the biased offline test set. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superior exposure debiasing performance of proposed methods. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/nancheng58/DebiasedSR_DRO.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommendations by providing external connectivity between items. However, there is limited research on distilling relevant knowledge in sequential recommendation, where item connections can change over time. To address this, we introduce the Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG), which incorporates such dynamic features of user behaviors into the original KG while emphasizing sequential relationships. The TKG captures both patterns of entity dynamics (nodes) and structural dynamics (edges). Considering real-world applications with large-scale and rapidly evolving user behavior patterns, we propose an efficient two-phase framework called TKG-SRec, which strengthens Sequential Recommendation with Temporal KGs. In the first phase, we learn dynamic entity embeddings using our novel Knowledge Evolution Network (KEN) that brings together pretrained static knowledge with evolving temporal knowledge. In the second stage, downstream sequential recommender models utilize these time-specific dynamic entity embeddings with compatible neural backbones like GRUs, Transformers, and MLPs. From our extensive experiments over four datasets, TKG-SRec outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a statistically significant 5% on average. Detailed analysis validates that such filtered temporal knowledge better adapts entity embedding for sequential recommendation. In summary, TKG-SRec provides an effective and efficient approach.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art sequential recommendation relies heavily on self-attention-based recommender models. Yet such models are computationally expensive and often too slow for real-time recommendation. Furthermore, the self-attention operation is performed at a sequence-level, thereby making low-cost incremental inference challenging. Inspired by recent advances in efficient language modeling, we propose linear recurrent units for sequential recommendation (LRURec). Similar to recurrent neural networks, LRURec offers rapid inference and can achieve incremental inference on sequential inputs. By decomposing the linear recurrence operation and designing recursive parallelization in our framework, LRURec provides the additional benefits of reduced model size and parallelizable training. Moreover, we optimize the architecture of LRURec by implementing a series of modifications to address the lack of non-linearity and improve training dynamics. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed LRURec, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art sequential recommenders. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LRURec, which consistently outperforms baselines by a significant margin. Results also highlight the efficiency of LRURec with our parallelized training paradigm and fast inference on long sequences, showing its potential to further enhance user experience in sequential recommendation.},

While there are several libraries that allow users to compare different recommender system models, there is no software library for comprehensive robustness evaluation of recommender system models under different scenarios.

abstract = {Although pretraining has garnered significant attention and popularity in recent years, its application in graph-based recommender systems is relatively limited. It is challenging to exploit prior knowledge by pretraining in widely used ID-dependent datasets. On the one hand, user-item interaction history in one dataset can hardly be transferred to other datasets through pretraining, where IDs are different. On the other hand, pretraining and finetuning on the same dataset leads to a high risk of overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel multitask pretraining framework named Unified Pretraining for Recommendation via Task Hypergraphs. For a unified learning pattern to handle diverse requirements and nuances of various pretext tasks, we design task hypergraphs to generalize pretext tasks to hyperedge prediction. A novel transitional attention layer is devised to discriminatively learn the relevance between each pretext task and recommendation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the superiority of UPRTH. Additional detailed investigations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

For the trend prediction, the attribute tags, as the essential description of items, can genuinely reflect the decision basis of consumers. However, few existing works explore the attribute trend in the specific community for e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on the community trend prediction on the item attribute and propose a unified framework that combines the dynamic evolution of two graph patterns to predict the attribute trend in a specific community. Specifically, we first design a community-attribute bipartite graph at each time step to learn the collaboration of different communities. Next, we transform the bipartite graph into a hypergraph to exploit the associations of different attribute tags in one community. Lastly, we introduce a dynamic evolution component based on the recurrent neural networks to capture the fashion trend of attribute tags. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets in a large e-commerce platform show the superiority of the proposed approach over several strong alternatives and demonstrate the ability to discover the community trend in advance.},

abstract = {The problem of data sparsity has long been a challenge in recommendation systems, and previous studies have attempted to address this issue by incorporating side information. However, this approach often introduces side effects such as noise, availability issues, and low data quality, which in turn hinder the accurate modeling of user preferences and adversely impact recommendation performance. In light of the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), which possess extensive knowledge bases and strong reasoning capabilities, we propose a novel framework called LLMRec that enhances recommender systems by employing three simple yet effective LLM-based graph augmentation strategies. Our approach leverages the rich content available within online platforms (e.g., Netflix, MovieLens) to augment the interaction graph in three ways: (i) reinforcing user-item interaction egde, (ii) enhancing the understanding of item node attributes, and (iii) conducting user node profiling, intuitively from the natural language perspective. By employing these strategies, we address the challenges posed by sparse implicit feedback and low-quality side information in recommenders. Besides, to ensure the quality of the augmentation, we develop a denoised data robustification mechanism that includes techniques of noisy implicit feedback pruning and MAE-based feature enhancement that help refine the augmented data and improve its reliability. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the effectiveness of LLMRec and clarify the benefits of our method in facilitating model optimization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our LLM-based augmentation approach over state-of-the-art techniques. To ensure reproducibility, we have made our code and augmented data publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/LLMRec.git.},

abstract = {Personalized recommendation has been instrumental in many real applications. Despite the great progress, the underlying multi-scenario characteristics (e.g., users may behave differently under different scenarios) are largely ignored by existing recommender systems. Intuitively, modeling different scenarios properly could significantly improve the recommendation accuracy, and some existing work has explored this direction. However, these work assumes the scenarios are explicitly given, and thus becomes less effective when such information is unavailable. To complicate things further, proper scenario modeling from data is challenging and the recommendation models may easily overfit to some scenarios. In this paper, we propose a multi-scenario learning framework, MUSENET, for personalized recommendation. The key idea of MUSENET is to learn multiple implicit scenarios from the user behaviors, with a careful design inspired by the causal interpretation of recommender systems to avoid the overfitting issue. Additionally, since users' repeat consumptions account for a large part of the user behavior data on many e-commerce platforms, a repeat-aware mechanism is integrated to handle users' repurchase intentions within each scenario. Comprehensive experimental results on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Negative sampling is essential for implicit collaborative filtering to generate negative samples from massive unlabeled data. Unlike existing strategies that consider items as a whole when selecting negative items, we argue that normally user interactions are mainly driven by some relevant, but not all, factors of items, leading to a new direction of negative sampling. In this paper, we introduce a novel disentangled negative sampling (DENS) method. We first disentangle the relevant and irrelevant factors of positive and negative items using a hierarchical gating module. Next, we design a factor-aware sampling strategy to identify the best negative samples by contrasting the relevant factors while keeping irrelevant factors similar. To ensure the credibility of the disentanglement, we propose to adopt contrastive learning and introduce four pairwise contrastive tasks, which enable to learn better disentangled representations of the relevant and irrelevant factors and remove the dependency on ground truth. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DENS against several state-of-the-art competitors, achieving over 7% improvement over the strongest baseline in terms of Recall@20 and NDCG@20.

abstract = {Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often utilize external knowledge graphs (KGs) to introduce rich semantic information and recommend relevant items through natural language dialogues. However, original KGs employed in existing CRSs are often incomplete and sparse, which limits the reasoning capability in recommendation. Moreover, only few of existing studies exploit the dialogue context to dynamically refine knowledge from KGs for better recommendation. To address the above issues, we propose the Variational Reasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender (VRICR). Our key idea is to incorporate the large dialogue corpus naturally accompanied with CRSs to enhance the incomplete KGs; and perform dynamic knowledge reasoning conditioned on the dialogue context. Specifically, we denote the dialogue-specific subgraphs of KGs as latent variables with categorical priors for adaptive knowledge graphs refactor. We propose a variational Bayesian method to approximate posterior distributions over dialogue-specific subgraphs, which not only leverages the dialogue corpus for restructuring missing entity relations but also dynamically selects knowledge based on the dialogue context. Finally, we infuse the dialogue-specific subgraphs to decode the recommendation and responses. We conduct experiments on two benchmark CRSs datasets. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Contrastive-learning-based neural networks have recently been introduced to recommender systems, due to their unique advantage of injecting collaborative signals to model deep representations, and the self-supervision nature in the learning process. Existing contrastive learning methods for recommendations are mainly proposed through introducing augmentations to the user-item (U-I) bipartite graphs. Such a contrastive learning process, however, is susceptible to bias towards popular items and users, because higher-degree users/items are subject to more augmentations and their correlations are more captured. In this paper, we advocate a &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;iamese &lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt;raph &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ontrastive &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;onsensus &lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;earning (SGCCL) framework, to explore intrinsic correlations and alleviate the bias effects for personalized recommendation. Instead of augmenting original U-I networks, we introduce siamese graphs, which are homogeneous relations of user-user (U-U) similarity and item-item (I-I) correlations. A contrastive consensus optimization process is also adopted to learn effective features for user-item ratings, user-user similarity, and item-item correlation. Finally, we employ the self-supervised learning coupled with the siamese item-item/user-user graph relationships, which ensures unpopular users/items are well preserved in the embedding space. Different from existing studies, SGCCL performs well on both overall and debiasing recommendation tasks resulting in a balanced recommender. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGCCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods with higher accuracy and greater long-tail item/user exposure.},

abstract = {Alleviating the examination and trust bias in ranking systems is an important research line in unbiased learning-to-rank (ULTR). Current methods typically use the propensity to correct the biased user clicks and then learn ranking models based on the corrected clicks. Though successes have been achieved, directly modifying the clicks suffers from the inherent high variance because the propensities are usually involved in the denominators of corrected clicks. The problem gets even worse in the situation of mixed examination and trust bias. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel ULTR method called Decomposed Ranking Debiasing (DRD). DRD is tailored for learning unbiased relevance models with low variance in the existence of examination and trust bias. Unlike existing methods that directly modify the original user clicks, DRD proposes to decompose each click prediction as the combination of a relevance term outputted by the ranking model and other bias terms. The unbiased relevance model, therefore, can be learned by fitting the overall click predictions to the biased user clicks. A joint learning algorithm is developed to learn the relevance and bias models' parameters alternatively. Theoretical analysis showed that, compared with existing methods, DRD has lower variance while retains unbiasedness. Empirical studies indicated that DRD can effectively reduce the variance and outperform the state-of-the-art ULTR baselines.},

abstract = {The Sparse Linear Method (SLIM) is a well-established approach for top-N recommendations. This article proposes several improvements that are enabled by the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a well-known optimization method with many application areas. First, we show that optimizing the original SLIM-objective by ADMM results in an approach where the training time is independent of the number of users in the training data, and hence trivially scales to large numbers of users. Second, the flexibility of ADMM allows us to switch on and off the various constraints and regularization terms in the original SLIM-objective, in order to empirically assess their contributions to ranking accuracy on given data. Third, we also propose two extensions to the original SLIM training-objective in order to improve recommendation accuracy further without increasing the computational cost. In our experiments on three well-known data-sets, we first compare to the original SLIM-implementation and find that not only ADMM reduces training time considerably, but also achieves an improvement in recommendation accuracy due to better optimization. We then compare to various state-of-the-art approaches and observe up to 25% improvement in recommendation accuracy in our experiments. Finally, we evaluate the importance of sparsity and the non-negativity constraint in the original SLIM-objective with sub-sampling experiments that simulate scenarios of cold-starting and large catalog sizes compared to relatively small user base, which often occur in practice.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet services and mobile devices provides an excellent opportunity to satisfy the strong demand for the personalized item or product recommendation. However, with the tremendous increase of users and items, personalized recommender systems still face several challenging problems: (1) the hardness of exploiting sparse implicit feedback; (2) the difficulty of combining heterogeneous data. To cope with these challenges, we propose a gated attentive-autoencoder (GATE) model, which is capable of learning fused hidden representations of items' contents and binary ratings, through a neural gating structure. Based on the fused representations, our model exploits neighboring relations between items to help infer users' preferences. In particular, a word-level and a neighbor-level attention module are integrated with the autoencoder. The word-level attention learns the item hidden representations from items' word sequences, while favoring informative words by assigning larger attention weights. The neighbor-level attention learns the hidden representation of an item's neighborhood by considering its neighbors in a weighted manner. We extensively evaluate our model with several state-of-the-art methods and different validation metrics on four real-world datasets. The experimental results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on top-N recommendation but also provide interpretable results attributed to the attention modules.},

abstract = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a popular type of machine learning models that use multiple layers of convolutional aggregation operations and non-linear activations to represent data. Recent studies apply GCNs to Collaborative Filtering (CF)-based recommender systems (RSs) by modeling user-item interactions as a bipartite graph and achieve superior performance. However, these models face difficulty in training with non-linear activations on large graphs. Besides, most GCN-based models could not model deeper layers due to the over-smoothing effect with the graph convolution operation. In this paper, we improve the GCN-based CF models from two aspects. First, we remove non-linearities to enhance recommendation performance, which is consistent with the theories in simple graph convolutional networks. Second, we obtain the initialization of the embedding for each node in the graph by computing the network embedding on the condensed graph, which alleviates the over smoothing problem in graph convolution aggregation operation with sparse interaction data. The proposed model is a linear model that is easy to train, scalable to large datasets, and shown to yield better efficiency and effectiveness on four real datasets.},

abstract = {Nowadays, it is more and more convenient for people to participate in group activities. Therefore, providing some recommendations to groups of individuals is indispensable. Group recommendation is the task of suggesting items or events for a group of users in social networks or online communities. In this work, we study group recommendation in a particular scenario, namely occasional group recommendation, which has few or no historical directly interacted items. Existing group recommendation methods mostly adopt attention-based preference aggregation strategies to capture group preferences. However, these models either ignore the complex high-order interactions between groups, users and items or greatly reduce the efficiency by introducing complex data structures. Moreover, occasional group recommendation suffers from the problem of data sparsity due to the lack of historical group-item interactions. In this work, we focus on addressing the aforementioned challenges and propose a novel group recommendation model called Self-Supervised Group Graph Collaborative Filtering (SGGCF). The goal of the model is capturing the high-order interactions between users, items and groups and alleviating the data sparsity issue in an efficient way. First, we explicitly model the complex relationships as a unified user-centered heterogeneous graph and devise a base group recommendation model. Second, we explore self-supervised learning on the graph with two kinds of contrastive learning module to capture the implicit relations between groups and items. At last, we treat the proposed contrastive learning loss as supplementary and apply a multi-task strategy to jointly train the BPR loss and the proposed contrastive learning loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in comparison to the state-of-the-art baselines.},

This information rich resource of textual reviews have clearly exhibited brand-new approaches to solving many of the important problems that have been perplexing the research community for years, such as the paradox of cold-start, the explanation of recommendation, and the automatic generation of user or item profiles. However, it is only recently that the fundamental importance of textual reviews has gained wide recognition, perhaps mainly because of the difficulty in formatting, structuring and analyzing the free-texts. In this research, we stress the importance of incorporating textual reviews for recommendation through phrase-level sentiment analysis, and further investigate the role that the texts play in various important recommendation tasks.},

However, evaluation of such systems through answering prompted clarifying questions requires significant human effort, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a conversational User Simulator, called USi, for automatic evaluation of such conversational search systems. Given a description of an information need, USi is capable of automatically answering clarifying questions about the topic throughout the search session. Through a set of experiments, including automated natural language generation metrics and crowdsourcing studies, we show that responses generated by USi are both inline with the underlying information need and comparable to human-generated answers. Moreover, we make the first steps towards multi-turn interactions, where conversational search systems asks multiple questions to the (simulated) user with a goal of clarifying the user need. To this end, we expand on currently available datasets for studying clarifying questions, i.e., Qulac and ClariQ, by performing a crowdsourcing-based multi-turn data acquisition. We show that our generative, GPT2-based model, is capable of providing accurate and natural answers to unseen clarifying questions in the single-turn setting and discuss capabilities of our model in the multi-turn setting. We provide the code, data, and the pre-trained model to be used for further research on the topic.},

abstract = {Bartering is a timeless practice that is becoming increasingly popular on the Web. Recommending trades for an online bartering platform shares many similarities with traditional approaches to recommendation, in particular the need to model the preferences of users and the properties of the items they consume. However, there are several aspects that make bartering problems interesting and challenging, specifically the fact that users are both suppliers and consumers, and that the trading environment is highly dynamic. Thus, a successful model of bartering requires us to understand not just users' preferences, but also the social dynamics of who trades with whom, and the temporal dynamics of when trades occur.We propose new models for bartering-based recommendation, for which we introduce three novel datasets from online bartering platforms. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods (based on matching algorithms) perform poorly on real-world platforms, as they rely on idealized assumptions that are not supported by real bartering data. We develop approaches based on Matrix Factorization in order to model the reciprocal interest between users and each other's items. We also find that the social ties between members have a strong influence, as does the time at which they trade, therefore we extend our model to be socially- and temporally-aware. We evaluate our approach on trades covering books, video games, and beers, where we obtain promising empirical performance compared to existing techniques.},

However, in social-aware recommendations, there are two issues which influence the inference of users' preferences, and haven't been well-studied in most existing methods: First, the preferences of a user may only partially match that of his friends in certain aspects, especially when considering a user with diverse interests. Second, for an individual, the influence strength of his friends might be different, as not all friends are equally helpful for modeling his preferences in the system. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Social Attentional Memory Network (SAMN) for social-aware recommendation. Specifically, we first design an attention-based memory module to learn user-friend relation vectors, which can capture the varying aspect attentions that a user share with his different friends. Then we build a friend-level attention component to adaptively select informative friends for user modeling. The two components are fused together to mutually enhance each other and lead to a finer extended model. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed SAMN model consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Furthermore, qualitative studies have been made to explore what the proposed attention-based memory module and friend-level attention have learnt, which provide insights into the model's learning process.},

abstract = {In this technical demonstration, we showcase the World's first personality-driven marketing content generation platform, called SoMin.ai. The platform combines deep multi-view personality profiling framework and style generative adversarial networks facilitating the automatic creation of content that appeals to different human personality types. The platform can be used for enhancement of the social networking user experience as well as for content marketing routines. Guided by the MBTI personality type, automatically derived from a user social network content, SoMin.ai generates new social media content based on the preferences of other users with a similar personality type aiming at enhancing the user experience on social networking venues as well diversifying the efforts of marketers when crafting new content for digital marketing campaigns. The real-time user feedback to the platform via the platform's GUI fine-tunes the content generation model and the evaluation results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed multi-view personality profiling framework when being applied in the content generation scenario. By leveraging content generation at a large scale, marketers will be able to execute more effective digital marketing campaigns at a lower cost.},

abstract = {Personalized recommendation often relies on user historical behaviors to provide items for users. It is intuitive that future information also contains essential messages as supplements to user historical behaviors. However, we cannot directly encode future information into models, since we are unable to get future information in online serving. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial future encoding (AFE) framework to make full use of informative future features in different types of recommendation models. Specifically, AFE contains a future-aware discriminator and a generator. The future-aware discriminator takes both common features and future features as inputs, working as a recommendation prophet to judge user-item pairs. In contrast, the generator is considered as a challenger, which generates items with only common features, aiming to confuse the future-aware prophet. The future-aware discriminator can inspire the generator (to be deployed online) to produce better results. We further conduct a multi-factor optimization to enable a fast and stable model convergence via the direct learning and knowledge distillation losses. Moreover, we have adopted AFE on both a list-wise RL-based ranking model and a point-wise ranking model to verify its universality. In experiments, we conduct sufficient evaluations on two large-scale datasets, achieving significant improvements on both offline and online evaluations. Currently, we have deployed AFE on a real-world system, affecting millions of users. The source code is in https://github.com/modriczhang/AFE.},

We assume a sequence of purchase events to be a stochastic process incorporating the following three factors: (a) user preference, (b) social effects received from other users, and (c) media advertising effects. As our user-purchase model incorporates the latent relationships between users and advertisers, it can infer the latent triggers of purchases. Experiments on real single-source data show that our model can (a) achieve high prediction accuracy for purchases, (b) discover the key information, i.e., popular items, influential users, and influential advertisers, (c) estimate the relative impact of the three factors on purchases, and (d) find user segments according to the estimated factors.},

We first discuss the long-term effect of optimizing marketing budget allocation decisions in the offline setting. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel game-theoretic offline value-based reinforcement learning method using mixed policies. The proposed method reduces the need to store infinitely many policies in previous methods to only constantly many policies, which achieves nearly optimal policy efficiency, making it practical and favorable for industrial usage. We further show that this method is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy, which cannot be achieved by previous value-based reinforcement learning methods for marketing budget allocation. Our experiments on a large-scale marketing campaign with tens-of-millions users and more than one billion budget verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods. The proposed method has been successfully deployed to serve all the traffic of this marketing campaign.},

Unfortunately, existing frameworks do not adequately support extensibility and adaptability and consequently pose significant challenges to rapid, iterative, and systematic, experimentation. In this work, we propose OpenRec, an open and modular Python framework that supports extensible and adaptable research in recommender systems. Each recommender is modeled as a computational graph that consists of a structured ensemble of reusable modules connected through a set of well-defined interfaces. We present the architecture of OpenRec and demonstrate that OpenRec provides adaptability, modularity and reusability while maintaining training efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Our case study illustrates how OpenRec can support an efficient design process to prototype and benchmark alternative approaches with inter-changeable modules and enable development and evaluation of new algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates two algorithms, BLIP and JLT, for creating differentially private data sketches of user profiles, in terms of their ability to protect a kNN collaborative filtering algorithm from an inference attack by third-parties. The transformed user profiles are employed in a user-based top-N collaborative filtering system. For the first time, a theoretical analysis of the BLIP is carried out, to derive expressions that relate its parameters to its performance. This allows the two techniques to be fairly compared. The impact of deploying these approaches on the utility of the system---its ability to make good recommendations, and on its privacy level---the ability of third-parties to make inferences about the underlying user preferences, is examined. An active inference attack is evaluated, that consists of the injection of a number of tailored sybil profiles into the system database. User profile data of targeted users is then inferred from the recommendations made to the sybils. Although the differentially private sketches are designed to allow the transformed user profiles to be published without compromising privacy, the attack we examine does not use such information and depends only on some pre-existing knowledge of some user preferences as well as the neighbourhood size of the kNN algorithm. Our analysis therefore assesses in practical terms a relatively weak privacy attack, which is extremely simple to apply in systems that allow low-cost generation of sybils. We find that, for a given differential privacy level, the BLIP injects less noise into the system, but for a given level of noise, the JLT offers a more compact representation.},

abstract = {Solving cold-start problems is indispensable to provide meaningful recommendation results for new users and items. Under sparsely observed data, unobserved user-item pairs are also a vital source for distilling latent users' information needs. Most present works leverage unobserved samples for extracting negative signals. However, such an optimisation strategy can lead to biased results toward already popular items by frequently handling new items as negative instances. In this study, we tackle the cold-start problems for new users/items by appropriately leveraging unobserved samples. We propose a knowledge graph (KG)-aware recommender based on graph neural networks, which augments labelled samples through pseudo-labelling. Our approach aggressively employs unobserved samples as positive instances and brings new items into the spotlight. To avoid exhaustive label assignments to all possible pairs of users and items, we exploit a KG for selecting probably positive items for each user. We also utilise an improved negative sampling strategy and thereby suppress the exacerbation of popularity biases. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements over the state-of-the-art KG-aware recommenders in a variety of scenarios; in particular, our methodology successfully improves recommendation performance for cold-start users/items.},

abstract = {Personalized recommender systems rely on knowledge of user preferences to produce recommendations. While those preferences are often obtained from past user interactions with the recommendation catalog, in some situations such observations are insufficient or unavailable. The most widely studied case is with new users, although other similar situations arise where explicit preference elicitation is valuable. At the same time, a seemingly disparate challenge is that there is a well-known popularity bias in many algorithmic approaches to recommender systems. The most common way of addressing this challenge is diversification, which tends to be applied to the output of a recommender algorithm, prior to items being presented to users. We tie these two problems together, showing a tight relationship. Our results show that popularity bias in preference elicitation contributes to popularity bias in recommendation. In particular, most elicitation methods directly optimize only for the relevance of recommendations that would result from collected preferences. This focus on recommendation accuracy biases the preferences collected. We demonstrate how diversification can instead be applied directly at elicitation time. Our model diversifies the preferences elicited using Multi-Armed Bandits, a classical exploration-exploitation framework from reinforcement learning. This leads to a broader understanding of users' preferences, and improved diversity and serendipity of recommendations, without necessitating post-hoc debiasing corrections.},

In this paper, we propose the RecGURU algorithm framework to generate a Generalized User Representation (GUR) incorporating user information across domains in sequential recommendation, even when there is minimum or no common users in the two domains. We propose a self-attentive autoencoder to derive latent user representations, and a domain discriminator, which aims to predict the origin domain of a generated latent representation. We propose a novel adversarial learning method to train the two modules to unify user embeddings generated from different domains into a single global GUR for each user. The learned GUR captures the overall preferences and characteristics of a user and thus can be used to augment the behavior data and improve recommendations in any single domain in which the user is involved. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two public cross-domain recommendation datasets as well as a large dataset collected from real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RecGURU boosts performance and outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential recommendation and cross-domain recommendation methods. The collected data will be released to facilitate future research.},

However, very few research works have examined the process of crowdfunding. In particular, none has studied how social networks help crowdfunding projects to succeed. To gain insights into the effects of social networks in crowdfunding, we analyze the hidden connections between the fundraising results of projects on crowdfunding websites and the corresponding promotion campaigns in social media. Our analysis considers the dynamics of crowdfunding from two aspects: how fundraising activities and promotional activities on social media simultaneously evolve over time, and how the promotion campaigns influence the final outcomes. From our investigation, we identify a number of important principles that provide a useful guide for devising effective campaigns. For example, we observe temporal distribution of customer interest, strong correlations between a crowdfunding project's early promotional activities and the final outcomes, and the importance of concurrent promotion from multiple sources. We then show that these discoveries can help predict several important quantities, including overall popularity and the success rate of the project. Finally, we show how to use these discoveries to help design crowdfunding sites.},

abstract = {The success of "infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix has been ascribed to a "long tail" phenomenon. To wit, while the majority of their inventory is not in high demand, in aggregate these "worst sellers," unavailable at limited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue. The long tail phenomenon, however, is in principle consistent with two fundamentally different theories. The first, and more popular hypothesis, is that a majority of consumers consistently follow the crowds and only a minority have any interest in niche content; the second hypothesis is that everyone is a bit eccentric, consuming both popular and specialty products. Based on examining extensive data on user preferences for movies, music, Web search, and Web browsing, we find overwhelming support for the latter theory. However, the observed eccentricity is much less than what is predicted by a fully random model whereby every consumer makes his product choices independently and proportional to product popularity; so consumers do indeed exhibit at least some a priori propensity toward either the popular or the exotic.Our findings thus suggest an additional factor in the success of infinite-inventory retailers, namely, that tail availability may boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of "one-stop shopping" for both their mainstream and niche interests. This hypothesis is further supported by our theoretical analysis that presents a simple model in which shared inventory stores, such as Amazon Marketplace, gain a clear advantage by satisfying tail demand, helping to explain the emergence and increasing popularity of such retail arrangements. Hence, we believe that the return-on-investment (ROI) of niche products goes beyond direct revenue, extending to second-order gains associated with increased consumer satisfaction and repeat patronage. More generally, our findings call into question the conventional wisdom that specialty products only appeal to a minority of consumers.},

abstract = {Online reviews enable consumers to engage with companies and provide important feedback. Due to the complexity of the high-dimensional text, these reviews are often simplified as a single numerical score, e.g., ratings or sentiment scores. This work empirically examines the causal effects of user-generated online reviews on a granular level: we consider multiple aspects, e.g., the Food and Service of a restaurant. Understanding consumers' opinions toward different aspects can help evaluate business performance in detail and strategize business operations effectively. Specifically, we aim to answer interventional questions such as What will the restaurant popularity be if the quality w.r.t. its aspect Service is increased by 10%? The defining challenge of causal inference with observational data is the presence of "confounder'', which might not be observed or measured, e.g., consumers' preference to food type, rendering the estimated effects biased and high-variance. To address this challenge, we have recourse to the multi-modal proxies such as the consumer profile information and interactions between consumers and businesses. We show how to effectively leverage the rich information to identify and estimate causal effects of multiple aspects embedded in online reviews. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world data corroborate the efficacy and shed light on the actionable insight of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Some popular product review sites such as Epinions allow users to establish a trust network among themselves, indicating who they trust in providing product reviews and ratings. While trust relations have been found to be useful in generating personalised recommendations, the relations between trust and product ratings has so far been overlooked. In this paper, we examine large datasets collected from Epinions and Ciao, two popular product review sites. We discover that in general users who trust each other tend to have smaller differences in their ratings as time passes, giving support to the theories of homophily and social influence. However, we also discover that this does not hold true across all trusted users. A trust relation does not guarantee that two users have similar preferences, implying that personalised recommendations based on trust relations do not necessarily produce more accurate predictions. We propose a method to estimate the strengths of trust relations so as to estimate the true influence among the trusted users. Our method extends the popular matrix factorisation technique for collaborative filtering, which allow us to generate more accurate rating predictions at the same time. We also show that the estimated strengths of trust relations correlate with the similarity among the users. Our work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between trust relations and product ratings, and suggests that trust networks may serve as a more general socialising venue than only an indication of similarity in user preferences.},

abstract = {Every day millions of people read Wikipedia. When navigating the vast space of available topics using hyperlinks, readers describe trajectories on the article network. Understanding these navigation patterns is crucial to better serve readers' needs and address structural biases and knowledge gaps. However, systematic studies of navigation on Wikipedia are hindered by a lack of publicly available data due to the commitment to protect readers' privacy by not storing or sharing potentially sensitive data. In this paper, we ask: How well can Wikipedia readers' navigation be approximated by using publicly available resources, most notably the Wikipedia clickstream data? We systematically quantify the differences between real navigation sequences and synthetic sequences generated from the clickstream data, in 6 analyses across 8 Wikipedia language versions. Overall, we find that the differences between real and synthetic sequences are statistically significant, but with small effect sizes, often well below 10%. This constitutes quantitative evidence for the utility of the Wikipedia clickstream data as a public resource: clickstream data can closely capture reader navigation on Wikipedia and provides a sufficient approximation for most practical downstream applications relying on reader data. More broadly, this study provides an example for how clickstream-like data can generally enable research on user navigation on online platforms while protecting users' privacy.},

Unlike existing supervised topic models, our proposal, supervised N-gram topic model (SNT), focuses on both a number of topics and power-law distribution in the word frequencies to extract topic specific N-grams. To achieve this goal, SNT takes a Bayesian nonparametric approach to topic sampling, which generates word distribution jointly with the given variable in textual order, and then form each N-gram word as a hierarchy of Pitman-Yor process priors. Experiments on labeled text data show that SNT is useful as a generative model for discovering more phrases that complement human experts and domain specific knowledge than the existing al- ternatives. The results show that SNT can be applied to various tasks such as automatic annotation.},

abstract = {The importance of the distribution of ratings on recommender systems (RS) is well-recognized. And yet, recommendation approaches based on latent factor models and recently introduced neural variants (e.g., NCF) optimize for the head of these distributions, potentially leading to large estimation errors for tail ratings. These errors in tail ratings that are far from the mean predicted rating fall out of a uni-modal assumption underlying these popular models, as we show in this paper. We propose to improve the estimation of tail ratings by extending traditional single latent representations (e.g., an item is represented by a single latent vector) with new multi-latent representations for better modeling these tail ratings. We show how to incorporate these multi-latent representations in an end-to-end neural prediction model that is designed to better reflect the underlying ratings distributions of items. Through experiments over six datasets, we find the proposed model leads to a significant improvement in RMSE versus a suite of benchmark methods. We also find that the predictions for the most polarized items are improved by more than 15%.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems typically rely on the interactions between a crowd of ordinary users and items, ignoring the fact that many real-world communities are notably influenced by a small group of key opinion leaders, whose feedback on items wields outsize influence. With important positions in the community (e.g. have a large number of followers), their elite opinions are able to diffuse to the community and further impact what items we buy, what media we consume, and how we interact with online platforms. Hence, this paper investigates how to develop a novel recommendation system by explicitly capturing the influence from key opinion leaders to the whole community. Centering around opinion elicitation and diffusion, we propose an end-to-end Graph-based neural model - GoRec. Specifically, to preserve the multi-relations between key opinion leaders and items, GoRec elicits the opinions from key opinion leaders with a translation-based embedding method. Moreover, GoRec adopts the idea of Graph Neural Networks to model the elite opinion diffusion process for improved recommendation. Through experiments on Goodreads and Epinions, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 10.75% and 9.28% on average in Top-K item recommendation.},

abstract = {In e-commerce advertising, the ad platform usually relies on auction mechanisms to optimize different performance metrics, such as user experience, advertiser utility, and platform revenue. However, most of the state-of-the-art auction mechanisms only focus on optimizing a single performance metric, e.g., either social welfare or revenue, and are not suitable for e-commerce advertising with various, dynamic, difficult to estimate, and even conflicting performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called Deep GSP auction, which leverages deep learning to design new rank score functions within the celebrated GSP auction framework. These new rank score functions are implemented via deep neural network models under the constraints of monotone allocation and smooth transition. The requirement of monotone allocation ensures Deep GSP auction nice game theoretical properties, while the requirement of smooth transition guarantees the advertiser utilities would not fluctuate too much when the auction mechanism switches among candidate mechanisms to achieve different optimization objectives. We deployed the proposed mechanisms in a leading e-commerce ad platform and conducted comprehensive experimental evaluations with both offline simulations and online A/B tests. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the Deep GSP auction compared to the state-of-the-art auction mechanisms.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed tremendous interest in understanding and predicting information spread on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. Existing diffusion prediction methods primarily exploit the sequential order of influenced users by projecting diffusion cascades onto their local social neighborhoods. However, this fails to capture global social structures that do not explicitly manifest in any of the cascades, resulting in poor performance for inactive users with limited historical activities.  In this paper, we present a novel variational autoencoder framework (Inf-VAE) to jointly embed homophily and influence through proximity-preserving social and position-encoded temporal latent variables. To model social homophily, Inf-VAE utilizes powerful graph neural network architectures to learn social variables that selectively exploit the social connections of users. Given a sequence of seed user activations, Inf-VAE uses a novel expressive co-attentive fusion network that jointly attends over their social and temporal variables to predict the set of all influenced users. Our experimental results on multiple real-world social network datasets, including Digg, Weibo, and Stack-Exchanges demonstrate significant gains (22% MAP@10) for Inf-VAE over state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models; we achieve massive gains for users with sparse activities, and users who lack direct social neighbors in seed sets.},

abstract = {Understanding user behavior and predicting future behavior on the web is critical for providing seamless user experiences as well as increasing revenue of service providers. Recently, thanks to the remarkable success of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), it has been widely used for modeling sequences of user behaviors. However, although sequential behaviors appear across multiple domains in practice, existing RNN-based approaches still focus on the single-domain scenario assuming that sequential behaviors come from only a single domain. Hence, in order to analyze sequential behaviors across multiple domains, they require to separately train multiple RNN models, which fails to jointly model the interplay among sequential behaviors across multiple domains. Consequently, they often suffer from lack of information within each domain. In this paper, we first introduce a practical but overlooked phenomenon in sequential behaviors across multiple domains, i.e.,domain switch where two successive behaviors belong to different domains. Then, we propose aDomain Switch-Aware Holistic Recurrent Neural Network (DS-HRNN) that effectively shares the knowledge extracted from multiple domains by systematically handlingdomain switch for the multi-domain scenario. DS-HRNN jointly models the multi-domain sequential behaviors and accurately predicts the future behaviors in each domain with only a single RNN model. Our extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DCHRNN outperforms existing RNN-based approaches and non-sequential baselines with significant improvements by up to 14.93% in terms of recall of the future behavior prediction.},

abstract = {Algorithmic recommendations shape music consumption at scale, and understanding the impact of various algorithmic models on how content is consumed is a central question for music streaming platforms. The ability to shift consumption towards less popular content and towards content different from user's typical historic tastes not only affords the platform ways of handling issues such as filter bubbles and popularity bias, but also contributes to maintaining a healthy and sustainable consumption patterns necessary for overall platform success.In this work, we view diversity as an enabler for shifting consumption and consider two notions of music diversity, based on taste similarity and popularity, and investigate how four different recommendation approaches optimized for user satisfaction, fare on diversity metrics. To investigate how the ranker complexity influences diversity, we use two well-known rankers and propose two new models of increased complexity: a feedback aware neural ranker and a reinforcement learning (RL) based ranker. We demonstrate that our models lead to gains in satisfaction, but at the cost of diversity. Such trade-off between model complexity and diversity necessitates the need for explicitly encoding diversity in the modeling process, for which we consider four types of approaches: interleaving based, submodularity based, interpolation, and RL reward modeling based. We find that our reward modeling based RL approach achieves the best trade-off between optimizing the satisfaction metric and surfacing diverse content, thereby enabling consumption shifting at scale. Our findings have implications for the design and deployment of practical approaches for music diversification, which we discuss at length.},

Without properly modeling and decoupling these two factors, one can hardly obtain any accurate user understanding nor item profiling from such user-generated data. In this paper, we study a new text mining problem that aims at differentiating a user's subjective composition of topical content in his/her review document from the entity's intrinsic properties. Motivated by the Item Response Theory (IRT), we model each review document as a user's detailed response to an item, and assume the response is jointly determined by the individuality of the user and the property of the item. We model the text-based response with a generative topic model, in which we characterize the items' properties and users' manifestations of them in a low-dimensional topic space. Via posterior inference, we separate and study these two components over a collection of review documents. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp review data verified the effectiveness of the proposed solution: it outperforms the state-of-art topic models with better predictive power in unseen documents, which is directly translated into improved performance in item recommendation and item summarization tasks.},

abstract = {Many real-world problems, such as web image analysis, document categorization and product recommendation, often exhibit dual-heterogeneity: heterogeneous features obtained in multiple views, and multiple tasks might be related to each other through one or more shared views. To address these Multi-Task Multi-View (MTMV) problems, we propose a tensor-based framework for learning the predictive multilinear structure from the full-order feature interactions within the heterogeneous data. The usage of tensor structure is to strengthen and capture the complex relationships between multiple tasks with multiple views. We further develop efficient multilinear factorization machines (MFMs) that can learn the task-specific feature map and the task-view shared multilinear structures, without physically building the tensor. In the proposed method, a joint factorization is applied to the full-order interactions such that the consensus representation can be learned. In this manner, it can deal with the partially incomplete data without difficulty as the learning procedure does not simply rely on any particular view. Furthermore, the complexity of MFMs is linear in the number of parameters, which makes MFMs suitable to large-scale real-world problems. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of MTMV problems.},

abstract = {Online reviews are valuable sources of information for a variety of decision-making processes such as purchasing products. As the number of online reviews is growing rapidly, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to identify those that are helpful. This has motivated research into the problem of identifying high quality and helpful reviews automatically. The current methods assume that the helpfulness of a review is independent from the readers of that review. However, we argue that the quality of a review may not be the same for different users. For example, a professional and an amateur photographer may rate the helpfulness of a review very differently. In this paper, we introduce the problem of predicting a personalized review quality for recommendation of helpful reviews. To address this problem, we propose a series of increasingly sophisticated probabilistic graphical models, based on Matrix Factorization and Tensor Factorization. We evaluate the proposed models using a database of 1.5 million reviews and more than 13 million quality ratings obtained from Epinions.com. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed latent factor models outperform the state-of-the art approaches using textual and social features. Finally, our experiments confirm that the helpfulness of a review is indeed not the same for all users and that there are some latent factors that affect a user's evaluation of the review quality.},

While on average, dwell time gives a reasonable estimate of user experience with a news article, it is not able to capture important aspects of user interaction with the page, such as how much time a user spends reading the article vs. viewing the comment posted by other users, or the actual proportion of article read by the user. In this paper, we propose a set of user engagement classes along with new user engagement metrics that, unlike dwell time, more accurately reflect user experience with the content. Our user engagement classes provide clear and interpretable taxonomy of user engagement with online news, and are defined based on amount of time user spends on the page, proportion of the article user actually reads and the amount of interaction users performs with the comments. Moreover, we demonstrate that our metrics are relatively easier to predict from the news article content, compared to the dwell time, making optimization of user engagement more attainable goal.},

Despite this global readership, little is known about why users read Wikipedia's various language editions. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comparative study by combining a large-scale survey of Wikipedia readers across 14 language editions with a log-based analysis of user activity. We proceed in three steps. First, we analyze the survey results to compare the prevalence of Wikipedia use cases across languages, discovering commonalities, but also substantial differences, among Wikipedia languages with respect to their usage. Second, we match survey responses to the respondents' traces in Wikipedia's server logs to characterize behavioral patterns associated with specific use cases, finding that distinctive patterns consistently mark certain use cases across language editions. Third, we show that certain Wikipedia use cases are more common in countries with certain socio-economic characteristics; e.g., in-depth reading of Wikipedia articles is substantially more common in countries with a low Human Development Index. These findings advance our understanding of reader motivations and behaviors across Wikipedia languages and have implications for Wikipedia editors and developers of Wikipedia and other Web technologies.},

abstract = {Recommender systems perform much better on users for which they have more information. This gives rise to a problem of satisfying users new to a system. The problem is even more acute considering that some of these hard to profile new users judge the unfamiliar system by its ability to immediately provide them with satisfying recommendations, and may quickly abandon the system when disappointed. Rapid profiling of new users by a recommender system is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories. The elicitation process becomes particularly effective when adapted to users' responses, making best use of users' time by dynamically modifying the questions to improve the evolving profile. In particular, we advocate a specialized version of decision trees as the most appropriate tool for this task. We detail an efficient tree learning algorithm, specifically tailored to the unique properties of the problem. Several extensions to the tree construction are also introduced, which enhance the efficiency and utility of the method. We implemented our methods within a movie recommendation service. The experimental study delivered encouraging results, with the tree-based bootstrapping process significantly outperforming previous approaches.},

abstract = {For cold-start recommendation, it is important to rapidly profile new users and generate a good initial set of recommendations through an interview process --- users should be queried adaptively in a sequential fashion, and multiple items should be offered for opinion solicitation at each trial. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that learns to conduct the interview process guided by a decision tree with multiple questions at each split. The splits, represented as sparse weight vectors, are learned through an L_1-constrained optimization framework. The users are directed to child nodes according to the inner product of their responses and the corresponding weight vector. More importantly, to account for the variety of responses coming to a node, a linear regressor is learned within each node using all the previously obtained answers as input to predict item ratings. A user study, preliminary but first in its kind in cold-start recommendation, is conducted to explore the efficient number and format of questions being asked in a recommendation survey to minimize user cognitive efforts. Quantitative experimental validations also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both the prediction accuracy and user cognitive efforts.},

abstract = {Word-of-mouth has proven an effective strategy for promoting products through social relations. Particularly, existing studies have convincingly demonstrated that word-of-mouth recommendations can boost users' prior expectation and hence encourage them to adopt a certain innovation, such as buying a book or watching a movie. However, less attention has been paid to studying the posterior effect of word-of-mouth recommendations, i.e., whether or not word-of-mouth recommendations can influence users' posterior evaluation on the products or services recommended to them, the answer to which is critical to estimating user satisfaction when proposing a word-of-mouth marketing strategy. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we empirically study the above issue and verify that word-of-mouth recommendations are strongly associated with users' posterior evaluation. Through elaborately designed statistical hypothesis tests we prove the causality that word-of-mouth recommendations directly prompt the posterior evaluation of receivers. Finally, we propose a method for investigating users' social influence, namely, their ability to affect followers' posterior evaluation via word-of-mouth recommendations, by examining the number of their followers and their sensitivity of discovering good items. The experimental results on real datasets show that our method can successfully identify 78% influential friends with strong social influence.},

abstract = {Items in recommender systems are usually associated with annotated attributes: for e.g., brand and price for products; agency for news articles, etc. Such attributes are highly informative and must be exploited for accurate recommendation. While learning a user preference model over these attributes can result in an interpretable recommender system and can hands the cold start problem, it suffers from two major drawbacks: data sparsity and the inability to model random effects. On the other hand, latent-factor collaborative filtering models have shown great promise in recommender systems; however, its performance on rare items is poor. In this paper we propose a novel model LFUM, which provides the advantages of both of the above models. We learn user preferences (over the attributes) using a personalized Bayesian hierarchical model that uses a combination(additive model) of a globally learned preference model along with user-specific preferences. To combat data-sparsity, we smooth these preferences over the item-taxonomy using an efficient forward-filtering and backward-smoothing inference algorithm. Our inference algorithms can handle both discrete attributes (e.g., item brands) and continuous attributes (e.g., item prices). We combine the user preferences with the latent-factor models and train the resulting collaborative filtering system end-to-end using the successful BPR ranking algorithm. In our extensive experimental analysis, we show that our proposed model outperforms several commonly used baselines and we carry out an ablation study showing the benefits of each component of our model.},

abstract = {Entity ranking, i.e., successfully positioning a relevant entity at the top of the ranking for a given query, is inherently difficult due to the potential mismatch between the entity's description in a knowledge base, and the way people refer to the entity when searching for it. To counter this issue we propose a method for constructing dynamic collective entity representations. We collect entity descriptions from a variety of sources and combine them into a single entity representation by learning to weight the content from different sources that are associated with an entity for optimal retrieval effectiveness. Our method is able to add new descriptions in real time and learn the best representation as time evolves so as to capture the dynamics of how people search entities. Incorporating dynamic description sources into dynamic collective entity representations improves retrieval effectiveness by 7% over a state-of-the-art learning to rank baseline. Periodic retraining of the ranker enables higher ranking effectiveness for dynamic collective entity representations.},

While many deep-web sites maintain document-oriented textual content (e.g., Wikipedia, PubMed, Twitter, etc.), which has traditionally been the focus of the deep-web literature, we observe that a significant portion of deep-web sites, including almost all online shopping sites, curate structured entities as opposed to text documents. Although crawling such entity-oriented content is clearly useful for a variety of purposes, existing crawling techniques optimized for document oriented content are not best suited for entity-oriented sites. In this work, we describe a prototype system we have built that specializes in crawling entity-oriented deep-web sites. We propose techniques tailored to tackle important subproblems including query generation, empty page filtering and URL deduplication in the specific context of entity oriented deep-web sites. These techniques are experimentally evaluated and shown to be effective.},

abstract = {Tagging plays an important role in many recent websites. Recommender systems can help to suggest a user the tags he might want to use for tagging a specific item. Factorization models based on the Tucker Decomposition (TD) model have been shown to provide high quality tag recommendations outperforming other approaches like PageRank, FolkRank, collaborative filtering, etc. The problem with TD models is the cubic core tensor resulting in a cubic runtime in the factorization dimension for prediction and learning.In this paper, we present the factorization model PITF (Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization) which is a special case of the TD model with linear runtime both for learning and prediction. PITF explicitly models the pairwise interactions between users, items and tags. The model is learned with an adaption of the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) criterion which originally has been introduced for item recommendation. Empirically, we show on real world datasets that this model outperforms TD largely in runtime and even can achieve better prediction quality. Besides our lab experiments, PITF has also won the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for graph-based tag recommendation.},

abstract = {Users of popular services like Twitter and Facebook are often simultaneously overwhelmed with the amount of information delivered via their social connections and miss out on much content that they might have liked to see, even though it was distributed outside of their social circle. Both issues serve as difficulties to the users and drawbacks to the services.Social media service providers can benefit from understanding user interests and how they interact with the service, potentially predicting their behaviors in the future. In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously predicting user decisions and modeling users' interests in social media by analyzing rich information gathered from Twitter. The task differs from conventional recommender systems as the cold-start problem is ubiquitous, and rich features, including textual content, need to be considered. We build predictive models for user decisions in Twitter by proposing Co-Factorization Machines (CoFM), an extension of a state-of-the-art recommendation model, to handle multiple aspects of the dataset at the same time. Additionally, we discuss and compare ranking-based loss functions in the context of recommender systems, providing the first view of how they vary from each other and perform in real tasks. We explore an extensive set of features and conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, concluding that CoFM with ranking-based loss functions is superior to state-of-the-art methods and yields interpretable latent factors.},

abstract = {The research issue of recommender systems has been treated as a classical regression problem over the decades and has obtained a great success. In the next generation of recommender systems, multi-criteria recommendation has been predicted as an important direction. Different from traditional recommender systems that aim particularly at recommending high-quality items evaluated by users' ratings, inmulti-criteria recommendation, quality only serves as one criterion, and many other criteria such as relevance, coverage, and diversity should be simultaneously optimized. Although recently there is work investigating each single criterion, there is rarely any literature that reports how each single criterion impacts each other and how to combine them in real applications. Thus in this paper, we study the relationship of two criteria, quality and relevance, as a preliminary work in multi-criteria recommendation. We first give qualitative and quantitative analysis of competitive quality-based and relevance-based algorithms in these two criteria to show that both algorithms cannot work well in the opposite criteria. Then we propose an integrated metric and finally investigate how to combine previous work together into an unified model. In the combination, we introduce a Continuous-time MArkov Process (CMAP) algorithm for ranking, which enables principled and natural integration with features derived from both quality-based and relevance-based algorithms. Through experimental verification, the combined methods can significantly outperform either single quality-based or relevance-based algorithms in the integrated metric and the CMAP model outperforms traditional combination methods by around 3%. Its linear complexity with respect to the number of users and items leads to satisfactory performance, as demonstrated by the around 7-hour computational time for over 480k users and almost 20k items.},

abstract = {We propose fLDA, a novel matrix factorization method to predict ratings in recommender system applications where a "bag-of-words" representation for item meta-data is natural. Such scenarios are commonplace in web applications like content recommendation, ad targeting and web search where items are articles, ads and web pages respectively. Because of data sparseness, regularization is key to good predictive accuracy. Our method works by regularizing both user and item factors simultaneously through user features and the bag of words associated with each item. Specifically, each word in an item is associated with a discrete latent factor often referred to as the topic of the word; item topics are obtained by averaging topics across all words in an item. Then, user rating on an item is modeled as user's affinity to the item's topics where user affinity to topics (user factors) and topic assignments to words in items (item factors) are learned jointly in a supervised fashion. To avoid overfitting, user and item factors are regularized through Gaussian linear regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) priors respectively. We show our model is accurate, interpretable and handles both cold-start and warm-start scenarios seamlessly through a single model. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a new dataset from Yahoo! Buzz where fLDA provides superior predictive accuracy in cold-start scenarios and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in warm-start scenarios. As a by-product, fLDA also identifies interesting topics that explains user-item interactions. Our method also generalizes a recently proposed technique called supervised LDA (sLDA) to collaborative filtering applications. While sLDA estimates item topic vectors in a supervised fashion for a single regression, fLDA incorporates multiple regressions (one for each user) in estimating the item factors.},

abstract = {The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB) --- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks. The empirical study on two large-scale real-world datasets and the live A/B testing on a commercial platform have demonstrated the superior performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we deal with the uncertainty of bidding for display advertising. Similar to the financial market trading, real-time bidding (RTB) based display advertising employs an auction mechanism to automate the impression level media buying; and running a campaign is no different than an investment of acquiring new customers in return for obtaining additional converted sales. Thus, how to optimally bid on an ad impression to drive the profit and return-on-investment becomes essential. However, the large randomness of the user behaviors and the cost uncertainty caused by the auction competition may result in a significant risk from the campaign performance estimation. In this paper, we explicitly model the uncertainty of user click-through rate estimation and auction competition to capture the risk. We borrow an idea from finance and derive the value at risk for each ad display opportunity. Our formulation results in two risk-aware bidding strategies that penalize risky ad impressions and focus more on the ones with higher expected return and lower risk. The empirical study on real-world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed risk-aware bidding strategies: yielding profit gains of 15.4% in offline experiments and up to 17.5% in an online A/B test on a commercial RTB platform over the widely applied bidding strategies.},
