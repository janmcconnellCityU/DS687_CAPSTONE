    "Its role is **narrowing**, not final selection.\n",

    "The input dataset (`bib_candidates.csv`) contains citation metadata only\n",
    "(year, title, venue, DOI). Abstracts are not included at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this notebook is one or more CSV files intended for **manual\n",
    "review in Excel**, where abstracts are read and final references are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does NOT do\n",
    "- It does not select final references\n",
    "- It does not evaluate abstracts\n",
    "- It does not attempt automated relevance decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Final judgment is intentionally human."
