2014,"Ratings meet reviews, a combined approach to recommend",Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/2645710.2645728,21,"Most existing recommender systems focus on modeling the ratings while ignoring the abundant information embedded in the review text. In this paper, we propose a unified model that combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering, harnessing the information of both ratings and reviews. We apply topic modeling techniques on the review text and align the topics with rating dimensions to improve prediction accuracy. With the information embedded in the review text, we can alleviate the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our model is able to learn latent topics that are interpretable. With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely"

We used applied ethnography, on-location interviewing and observation, to get an accurate picture of user activity. We were especially interested in the role of customer ratings and reviews and what kind of strategies users had developed for such an environment. Our results underline the need to develop recommender systems as a whole. The way the recommendations are shown affects which items get picked, and for improving the interface, it is necessary to study the whole in addition to studying the parts in isolation."

2019,"Exploiting Ratings, Reviews and Relationships for Item Recommendations in Topic Based Social Networks",The World Wide Web Conference,10.1145/3308558.3313473,19,"Many e-commerce platforms today allow users to give their rating scores and reviews on items as well as to establish social relationships with other users. As a result, such platforms accumulate heterogeneous data including numeric scores, short textual reviews, and social relationships. However, many recommender systems only consider historical user feedbacks in modeling user preferences. More specifically, most existing recommendation approaches only use rating scores but ignore reviews and social relationships in the user-generated data. In this paper, we propose TSNPF-a latent factor model to effectively capture user preferences and item features. Employing Poisson factorization, TSNPF fully exploits the wealth of information in rating scores, review text and social relationships altogether. It extracts topics of items and users from the review text and makes use of similarities between user pairs with social relationships, which results in a comprehensive understanding of user preferences. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our TSNPF approach is highly effective at recommending items to users."

2013,Context-aware review helpfulness rating prediction,Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/2507157.2507183,18,"Online reviews play a vital role in the decision-making process for online users. Helpful reviews are usually buried in a large number of unhelpful reviews, and with the consistently increasing number of reviews, it becomes more and more difficult for online users to find helpful reviews. Therefore most online review websites allow online users to rate the helpfulness of a review and a global helpfulness score is computed for the review based on its available ratings. However, in reality, user-specified helpfulness ratings for reviews are very sparse - a few reviews attract large numbers of helpfulness ratings while most reviews obtain few or even no helpfulness ratings. The available helpfulness ratings are too sparse for online users to assess the helpfulness of reviews. Also the helpfulness of a review is not necessarily equally useful for all users and users with different background may treat the helpfulness of a review very differently. The user idiosyncracy of review helpfulness motivates us to study the problem of review helpfulness rating prediction in this paper. We first identify various types of context information, model them mathematically, and propose a context-aware review helpfulness rating prediction framework CAP. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of context awareness in solving the review helpfulness rating prediction problem."
2013,Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text,Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/2507157.2507163,18,"In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems"

2019,Leveraging Ratings and Reviews with Gating Mechanism for Recommendation,Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,10.1145/3357384.3357919,17,"Recommender system plays an important role to provide people with personalized information based on their history records. However, it is still a challenge to capture the preference of users accurately due to the sparsity of rating data and the heterogeneity of review data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep collaborative filtering model that jointly learns latent representations from ratings and reviews. Specifically, the model learns the rating feature and textual feature based on ratings and reviews simultaneously. Two embedding layers are employed to learn rating feature for users and items based on the user and item interactions, and two attention-based GRU networks learn context-aware representation from user and item reviews. Then a gating mechanism is used to leverage contributions from rating feature and textual feature. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the keywords in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the predictions with the attention mechanism."

In this work, we show that the inclusion of author preferences in sentiment rating prediction of reviews improves the correlation with ground ratings, over a generic author independent rating prediction model. The overall sentiment rating prediction for a review has been shown to improve by capturing facet level rating. We show that this can be further developed by considering author preferences in predicting the facet level ratings, and hence the overall review rating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate author preferences in rating prediction."

Users may provide numerical ratings, or implicit interactions, but may also provide textual reviews. Although many algorithms have been proposed to jointly learn a model over both interactions and textual data, there is room to improve the many factorization models that are proven to work well on interactions data, but are not designed to exploit textual information. Our focus in this work is to propose a simple, yet easily applicable and effective, method to incorporate review data into such factorization models. In particular, we propose to build the user and item embeddings within the topic space of a topic model learned from the review data. This has several advantages: we observe that initializing the user and item embeddings in topic space leads to faster convergence of the factorization algorithm to a model that out-performs models initialized randomly, or with other state-of-the-art initialization strategies. Moreover, constraining user and item factors to topic space allows for the learning of an interpretable model that users can visualise."

2025,Beyond Immediate Click: Engagement-Aware and MoE-Enhanced Transformers for Sequential Movie Recommendation,Proceedings of the Nineteenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/3705328.3748076,13,"Modern video streaming services heavily rely on recommender systems. Although there are many methods for content personalization and recommendation, sequential recommendation models stand out due to their ability to summarize user behavior over time. We propose a novel sequential recommendation framework to address the following key issues: suboptimal negative sampling strategies, fixed user-history context lengths, and single-task optimization objectives, insufficient engagement-aware learning, and short-sighted prediction horizons, ultimately improving both immediate and multi-step next-title prediction for video streaming services. In this work, we propose a novel approach to capture patterns of interaction at different time scales. We also align long-term user happiness with instantaneous intent signals using multi-task learning with engagement-aware personalized loss. Finally, we extend traditional next-item prediction into a next-K forecasting task using a training strategy with soft positive label. Extensive experiments on large-scale streaming data validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model outperforms the baseline in NDCG@1 by up to 3.52% under realistic ranking scenarios showing the effectiveness of our engagement-aware and MoE-enhanced designs. Results also show that soft-label Multi-K training is a practical and scalable extension, and that a balanced personalized negative sampling strategy generalizes well. Our framework outperforms baselines across all ranking metrics, providing a robust solution for production-scale streaming recommendations."
2021,Combating Selection Biases in Recommender Systems with a Few Unbiased Ratings,Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,10.1145/3437963.3441799,13,"Recommendation datasets are prone to selection biases due to self-selection behavior of users and item selection process of systems. This makes explicitly combating selection biases an essential problem in training recommender systems. Most previous studies assume no unbiased data available for training. We relax this assumption and assume that a small subset of training data is unbiased. Then, we propose a novel objective that utilizes the unbiased data to adaptively assign propensity weights to biased training ratings. This objective, combined with unbiased performance estimators, alleviates the effects of selection biases on the training of recommender systems. To optimize the objective, we propose an efficient algorithm that minimizes the variance of propensity estimates for better generalized recommender systems. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm the advantages of our approach in significantly reducing both the error of rating prediction and the variance of propensity estimation."

2016,Fifty Shades of Ratings: How to Benefit from a Negative Feedback in Top-N Recommendations Tasks,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/2959100.2959170,13,"Conventional collaborative filtering techniques treat a top-n recommendations problem as a task of generating a list of the most relevant items. This formulation, however, disregards an opposite -- avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start"

It is characterized by three unique features: First, rated items are multi-typed, including tracks, albums, artists and genres; Second, items are arranged within a four level taxonomy, proving itself effective in coping with a severe sparsity problem that originates from the unusually large number of items (compared to, e.g., movie ratings datasets"
2008,Boosting collaborative filtering based on statistical prediction errors,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/1454008.1454011,13,"User-based collaborative filtering methods typically predict a user's item ratings as a weighted average of the ratings given by similar users, where the weight is proportional to the user similarity. Therefore, the accuracy of user similarity is the key to the success of the recommendation, both for selecting neighborhoods and computing predictions. However, the computed similarities between users are somewhat inaccurate due to data sparsity.For a given user, the set of neighbors selected for predicting ratings on different items typically exhibit overlap. Thus, error terms contributing to rating predictions will tend to be shared, leading to correlation of the prediction errors.Through a set of case studies, we discovered that for a given user, the prediction errors on different items are correlated to the similarities of the corresponding items, and to the degree to which they share common neighbors.We propose a framework to improve prediction accuracy based on these statistical prediction errors. Two different strategies to estimate the prediction error on a desired item are proposed. Our experiments show that these approaches improve the prediction accuracy of standard user based methods significantly, and they outperform other state-of-the-art methods."
2024,Calibrating the Predictions for Top-N Recommendations,Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,10.1145/3640457.3688177,12,"Well-calibrated predictions of user preferences are essential for many applications. Since recommender systems typically select the top-N items for users, calibration for those top-N items, rather than for all items, is important. We show that previous calibration methods result in miscalibrated predictions for the top-N items, despite their excellent calibration performance when evaluated on all items. In this work, we address the miscalibration in the top-N recommended items. We first define evaluation metrics for this objective and then propose a generic method to optimize calibration models focusing on the top-N items. It groups the top-N items by their ranks and optimizes distinct calibration models for each group with rank-dependent training weights. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, using diverse classes of recommender models."

Predicting a user's rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users."

Memory based collaborative filtering algorithms assign weights to the users to capture similarities between them. The weighted average of similar users' ratings for the test item is output as prediction. We propose a memory based algorithm that is markedly different from the existing approaches. We use preference relations instead of absolute ratings for similarity calculations, as preference relations between items are generally more consistent than ratings across like-minded users. Each user's ratings are viewed as a preference graph. Similarity weights are learned using an iterative method motivated by online learning. These weights are used to create an aggregate preference graph. Ratings are inferred to maximally agree with this aggregate graph. The use of preference relations allows the rating of an item to be influenced by other items, which is not the case in the weighted-average approaches of the existing techniques. This is very effective when the data is sparse, specially for the items rated by few users. Our experiments show that the our method outperforms other methods in the sparse regions. However, for dense regions, sometimes our results are comparable to the competing approaches, and sometimes worse."

They explore other trust characteristics in a very limited setting. The graph based model, designed using entire user-user social information, impacts performance and escalates complexities in model learning. To alleviate these issues of graph learning, graph recommender seeks assistance from matrix factorization techniques.
